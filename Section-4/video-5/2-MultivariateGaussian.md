### Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution (also called the Multivariate Normal Distribution) is the generalization of the normal (Gaussian) distribution to multiple variables. Instead of just one variable, it deals with multiple variables that may be correlated.

### Why Is This Important?
Used in machine learning, statistics, and probabilistic modeling.

Forms the basis of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Anomaly Detection.

Helps in dimensionality reduction (PCA) and Kalman Filters (used in robotics & tracking
