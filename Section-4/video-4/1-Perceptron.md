A Perceptron is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks, and itâ€™s used for binary classification (deciding between two classes). Think of it like a tiny brain that learns to draw a straight line to separate two types of things.

How It Works (Beginner-Friendly ðŸŒ±)

Imagine Miya wants to decide whether she should sit on your lap or not. She has two factors to consider:

1. Is your laptop open? (She likes to block your screen ðŸ˜†)

2. Are you giving her attention?

Miya can assign weights to these factors and add them up. If the total score is high enough, she decides, "Yes, I'll sit on Asahi's lap!" Otherwise, she does something else (like judge you silently from a distance ðŸ˜†).

Limitations ðŸš§

The Perceptron can only handle linearly separable problems, meaning it can only draw a straight line to classify things. It cannot handle complex problems like XOR (where classes are not separable by a straight line).
