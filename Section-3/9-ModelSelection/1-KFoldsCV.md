### What is K-Fold Cross-Validation?
K-Fold Cross-Validation is a technique used in machine learning to evaluate a model’s performance more reliably by splitting the data into multiple folds (subsets).

Instead of training on one fixed training set and testing on one fixed test set, K-Fold CV does this:

* Splits the dataset into K equal parts (folds).
* Trains the model K times, each time using K-1 folds for training and 1 fold for validation.
* The performance scores from all K iterations are averaged to give a final performance estimate.

This method helps avoid overfitting and ensures the model is evaluated on different subsets of the data.

### How Can We Use K-Fold in Unsupervised Learning?
You can still use K-Fold in some cases, but we have to modify the approach:

1. For Clustering (e.g., K-Means)

* Instead of splitting into train/val sets, we perform clustering on different folds and evaluate using silhouette score, inertia, or other metrics.

* Here, K-Fold ensures that we validate our clustering method on different subsets instead of just the whole dataset at once.

2. For Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA, Autoencoders)

* We can apply PCA on training folds and test how well it reconstructs the validation fold.

* This helps test how well PCA generalizes across different parts of the dataset.

### Summary
✔ K-Fold works differently in unsupervised learning because there's no clear label to compare predictions against.

✔ Instead, we use metrics like silhouette score (for clustering) or reconstruction error (for PCA/Autoencoders) to evaluate performance.

✔ The concept of splitting the dataset and testing on different subsets still helps, but the way we measure success changes.
