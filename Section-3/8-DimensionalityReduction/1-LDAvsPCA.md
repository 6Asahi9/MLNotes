### When to Use Which?
### Use LDA when:

* You believe the variance within each class is roughly the same.
* The classes are linearly separable.
* You want a simpler model that’s easier and faster to compute.

### Use QDA when:

* You believe the classes have different variances (covariances).
* the separation between classes is non-linear.
* You need a more flexible model, and the extra complexity is worth it for improved accuracy.

LDA is simpler and works well when the data is “nice and neat,” with similar spreads.

QDA is more complex and can handle data with different spreads, making it more flexible for non-linear class boundaries.
