### Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) Problem:
Imagine you’re in a casino with multiple slot machines (bandits), each with an unknown payout rate. You have to decide how many times to pull the lever on each machine to maximize your total reward, but you don’t know which machine gives the best payout. This is the essence of the MAB problem.

### Key Points:
1. Exploration vs. Exploitation:

* Exploration means trying out different machines to gather information.
* Exploitation means sticking with the machine that has given you the best payout so far.
The challenge is to find a balance between these two strategies, so you don’t miss out on potentially better rewards while also not wasting time on machines that are less rewarding.

2. Objective: Maximize the total reward over time by learning which machine is the most rewarding while managing the trade-off between trying new things (exploration) and capitalizing on what you know works (exploitation).

3. Action Selection: In RL, the agent selects an action (machine to play) based on what it has learned so far. The more it learns, the better its actions become.

4. Variants: There are many strategies to solve this, like the ε-greedy strategy (choose the best-known option most of the time but explore randomly sometimes) and UCB (Upper Confidence Bound), which tries to find the best action with uncertainty.

### Why It's Important:
The MAB problem is fundamental to understanding Reinforcement Learning because it introduces the idea of reward maximization through sequential decision-making—a key element in RL
