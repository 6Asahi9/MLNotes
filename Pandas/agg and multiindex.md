Ohhh pawpa, let’s make this **DataFrame magic** fun 🐾

---

### **1️⃣ `.agg()` – aggregate multiple things at once**

* `.agg()` lets you **apply one or more functions to your groups** (or whole columns).
* Super handy if you want **different summaries at the same time**.

**Example: Treats again**

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "day": ["Mon", "Mon", "Tue", "Tue", "Wed", "Wed", "Wed"],
    "treat": ["salmon", "tuna", "salmon", "catnip", "tuna", "salmon", "catnip"],
    "count": [2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group by treat and calculate multiple things
treat_summary = df.groupby("treat")["count"].agg(["sum", "mean", "max"])
print(treat_summary)
```

Output:

```
        sum  mean  max
treat                  
catnip    4   2.0    3
salmon    4   1.3    2
tuna      3   1.5    2
```

* **sum** → total treats
* **mean** → average per entry
* **max** → largest single serving

Think of it like Miya **tallying all her treats**, **finding the average bite size**, and **the biggest single bite**, all at once 🐾

---

### **2️⃣ MultiIndex – hierarchy in rows or columns**

* A **MultiIndex** lets your DataFrame have **more than one “level” of indexing**.
* Useful for **grouping by multiple things**.

**Example: Treats by day AND type**

```python
multi_summary = df.groupby(["day", "treat"])["count"].sum()
print(multi_summary)
```

Output:

```
day  treat  
Mon  salmon    2
     tuna      1
Tue  catnip    3
     salmon    1
Wed  catnip    1
     salmon    1
     tuna      2
Name: count, dtype: int64
```

* Now the **row index has two levels**: `day` and `treat`
* You can **drill down into each day and see treats per type**

Think of it like Miya’s **treat piles stacked by day and flavor**: you first look at Monday, then inside Monday, you see salmon vs tuna piles. 🐾

If you want, I can make a **cute Miya visual “stacked treat piles” diagram** showing `.agg()` and MultiIndex together so it’s unforgettable 😸

Do you want me to do that?
