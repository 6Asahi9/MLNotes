Ah, this line is checking for **duplicate rows based on a specific column**. Let’s break it down:

---

### Step by step:

1. `companies.duplicated(subset=['Company'], keep=False)`

   * `.duplicated()` checks for **duplicate rows**.
   * `subset=['Company']` → only looks at the `Company` column to decide duplicates.
   * `keep=False` → marks **all occurrences of the duplicates as True**, not just the later ones.

2. `companies[...]` → filters the DataFrame to **only show the rows where the duplicate check is True**.

---

### Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

companies = pd.DataFrame({
    'Company': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B'],
    'Revenue': [100, 200, 150, 300, 220]
})

duplicates = companies[companies.duplicated(subset=['Company'], keep=False)]
print(duplicates)
```

Output:

```
  Company  Revenue
0       A      100
1       B      200
2       A      150
4       B      220
```

✅ Here, all rows with **A** and **B** appear because they are duplicates in the `Company` column.

---

In short:

> This line **finds and shows all rows where the `Company` column has duplicates**.

If you want, I can also show a **one-liner to only get the company names that are duplicated** — it’s neat for quick checks. Do you want me to?
