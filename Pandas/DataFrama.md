Sure! Here’s a **simplified, friendly version in my own words** 🐾

### **Common DataFrame Attributes**

DataFrames have some built-in properties (attributes) that help you **see or access their structure**:

* **`columns`** → gives you the names of all the columns.
* **`dtypes`** → shows the type of data in each column (like int, float, object).
* **`iloc`** → lets you pick rows or columns by **integer position**.
* **`loc`** → lets you pick rows or columns by **label** or a **True/False condition**.
* **`shape`** → tells you the size of the DataFrame as `(rows, columns)`.
* **`values`** → gives you the underlying **NumPy array** of the DataFrame.

### **Common DataFrame Methods**

Methods are **functions you can call on a DataFrame** to do things:

* **`apply()`** → run a function along rows or columns.
* **`copy()`** → make a separate copy of the DataFrame.
* **`describe()`** → get basic statistics for numeric columns (min, max, mean, percentiles, counts, and data types).
* **`drop()`** → remove rows or columns by name.
* **`groupby()`** → split data into groups, do something to each group, then combine results.
* **`head(n=5)`** → see the first n rows (default is 5).
* **`info()`** → quick summary of the DataFrame (columns, data types, non-null counts).
* **`isna()`** → check where values are missing (True if null). Alias: `isnull()`.
* **`sort_values()`** → sort the DataFrame based on a column or columns.
* **`value_counts()`** → count how many times each unique value appears.
* **`where()`** → keep values where a condition is True, replace the rest.

Think of a DataFrame like **Miya’s treat board** 🐾:

* **Attributes** are like **looking at the board**: names of treats (`columns`), how many treats (`shape`), what type of treats (`dtypes`).
* **Methods** are like **interacting with the treats**: sorting them, grouping them by flavor, checking which ones are missing, or giving yourself a preview (`head`) before digging in.

If you want, I can make a **tiny Miya-themed cheat sheet** with **paw prints for attributes and treats for methods** to make it super visual 😸. Do you want me to do that?
