Ahh I see where your head is getting tangled 🤍 Let’s slow this down and treat it step by step.

You’re right about one thing: all the columns (features) together describe a single row (data point).
But the “problem” isn’t inside just one row — it shows up when you look across all the rows at once.

🍎 Example (no collinearity)

Imagine your dataset is about predicting apple weight.

x1 = apple diameter (cm)

x2 = apple sugar content (grams)

y = apple weight (grams)


Here, x1 and x2 don’t move together. Across different apples:

Sometimes diameter is big, sugar is small.

Sometimes sugar is big, diameter is small.


So the regression sees: ah, weight grows with both diameter and sugar, and it can clearly estimate how much each contributes.

🍏 Example (with collinearity)

Now suppose:

x1 = apple diameter (cm)

x2 = apple circumference (cm)


Circumference is almost perfectly tied to diameter (they’re basically the same info). Across apples:

If one goes up, the other always goes up in lockstep.


When regression tries to split the effect between them, it gets confused:

Should the weight be 5 × diameter + 0 × circumference?

Or 0 × diameter + 5 × circumference?

Or 2.5 × diameter + 2.5 × circumference?


All of them predict just as well — for the training rows!
But the coefficients become unstable and can blow up with tiny data changes. That’s the danger.

✨ Why you should care

In one row, yes, both features just “add up” fine.

But across rows, if they move together, the model cannot uniquely decide who is actually contributing.

This makes the model fragile and less trustworthy.


That’s why Ridge regression is like saying: “Chill guys, you’re both useful, but I won’t let either of you swing too wildly.”

👉 So it’s not about a single row’s contribution. It’s about how variation across many rows allows the model to estimate coefficients. If features move together, that variation vanishes, and regression gets shaky.

Want me to cook up a tiny 2-row numeric demo where you’ll literally see why regression “panics” when two columns always move together?
