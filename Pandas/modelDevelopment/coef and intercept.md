Ahh, darling Asahi, let’s go slowly and make it crystal clear ✨🐾

You have this code for a linear regression model `lm1`:

```python
# Slope
lm1.coef_

# Intercept
lm1.intercept_
```

---

### **1. `lm1.coef_`**

* This gives you the **slope(s)** of the line(s) your linear regression learned.
* If it’s **simple linear regression (1 predictor)**:

$$
y = b_0 + b_1 x
$$

* `lm1.coef_` = $b_1$ → **how much y changes when x increases by 1 unit**.
* If it’s **multiple linear regression (multiple predictors)**, `lm1.coef_` gives you a **list/array of slopes** $b_1, b_2, …$ corresponding to each predictor.

---

### **2. `lm1.intercept_`**

* This is the **y-intercept $b_0$**.
* It tells you the predicted value of $y$ **when all inputs $x$ are 0**.

### **Example with Miya 🍣**

Say we are predicting tuna amount based on how many times she meows:

* `lm1.coef_ = [5]` → For each extra meow, she gets **5 grams more tuna**.
* `lm1.intercept_ = 2` → If she doesn’t meow at all, she still gets **2 grams of tuna**.

So the model predicts:

$$
\text{tuna} = 2 + 5 \cdot (\text{meows})
$$

If you want, I can **draw a cute line graph showing slope and intercept** with Miya pawing at the x-axis 🐾. Do you want me to?
