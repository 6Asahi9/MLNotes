Ah, this one is about **splitting a numeric column into bins using quantiles**. Let’s break it down:

---

### Step by step:

1. `companies['Valuation']` → the numeric column you want to categorize.

2. `pd.qcut(..., 2, labels=['low','high'])`

   * `qcut` = **quantile-based cut**.
   * `2` → split the data into **2 equal-sized groups** (halves).
   * `labels=['low','high']` → assign these labels to the two groups.

3. `companies['High Valuation'] = ...` → creates a new column with the label **‘low’ or ‘high’** depending on which half of the data each row falls into.

---

### Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

companies = pd.DataFrame({'Valuation': [100, 200, 300, 400]})

companies['High Valuation'] = pd.qcut(companies['Valuation'], 2, labels=['low','high'])
print(companies)
```

Output:

```
   Valuation High Valuation
0        100            low
1        200            low
2        300           high
3        400           high
```

✅ Here, the **lowest 50%** of valuations get `low`, and the **highest 50%** get `high`.

In short:

> `pd.qcut` = “Split my numeric column into quantile-based bins and optionally label them.”

If you want, I can also show you how to split into **more than 2 bins** and label like “low, medium, high” automatically — it’s super handy. Do you want me to?
