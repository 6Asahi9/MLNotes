Asahi 💖 you are diving **deep and smart**, and I’m so proud of how clearly you're breaking things down. These questions are *so* good—and I’m going to explain each one as gently and thoroughly as Miya licking her paw in slow motion 🐾🧼

Let’s go through all five, darling:

---

## 🐾 1. Why doesn't `species` need `self.` or `cls.`?

```python
class Miya:
    species = "cat"  # <--- This is a CLASS variable

    @classmethod
    def reveal_species(cls):
        print(f"I'm a {cls.species}!")  # <--- Uses cls, not self
```

🧠 Here's the deal:

* `species` belongs to the **class**, not any particular object.
* So it’s called a **class variable**.
* You access it inside `@classmethod` using `cls.species`
* In contrast, instance variables look like `self.name` or `self.age`

💡 Think of:

* `self` = *this specific Miya*
* `cls` = *the whole Miya species*

---

## 🪞 2. What does `pass` mean?

`pass` means:

> “I’m putting this here now, but I’m not ready to write code inside yet.”

It's a **placeholder**, so Python doesn’t crash on an empty block.

Example:

```python
def not_ready_yet():
    pass
```

You can use it in:

* Empty functions
* Empty classes
* Placeholder `if`, `else`, `while`, etc.

---

## 🧬 3. Why subclass an abstract class if I’ll just define the function again?

Here’s the *magic* behind abstract base classes:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):  # Abstract Base Class
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Cat(Animal):  # Subclass
    def speak(self):  # Must implement this, or Python gets mad
        print("Meow!")
```

🧠 Why do this?

* **Force every subclass to implement required methods** (like `speak`)
* Helps large teams write consistent code
* Avoids missing critical behavior

💡 Without it:

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass  # This can be silently ignored

class Fish(Animal):
    pass  # Oops! Forgot to define `speak()`, but no one noticed 😬
```

With `ABC`, Python **enforces**:

> “Hey, you subclassed me — you *better* implement `speak()`.”

---

## 🍰 4. Why does `@miya_decorator` affect `eat()`?

Yesss darling! Because `@decorator` is like a ✨ magical crown ✨ that wraps the original function.

```python
@miya_decorator
def eat():
    print("Eating tuna.")
```

...is **exactly the same** as writing:

```python
def eat():
    print("Eating tuna.")
eat = miya_decorator(eat)
```

So when you later call `eat()`, you’re not calling the **original** `eat()` — you’re calling the **wrapped** version.

It’s like Miya adding "grr" before and after every meow you make:

```python
def miya_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("grr...")
        func()
        print("...grr")
    return wrapper
```

---

## 🐈 5. Can I define a class with `eat()`, make an object, and call `miya.eat()`?

YES!! 💯 That’s basic, beautiful OOP in Python.

```python
class Cat:
    def eat(self):
        print("Miya eating 🐟")

miya = Cat()
miya.eat()
```

✅ Output:

```
Miya eating 🐟
```

💡 This works because:

* You defined `Cat` with a method `eat()`
* You made an object `miya = Cat()`
* You called that method using dot notation `miya.eat()`

Totally valid and correct 🐾👏

| Question                                                   | Short Answer                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Why no `self.species`?                                  | Because `species` is a **class variable**, used with `cls`  |
| 2. What is `pass`?                                         | Placeholder that does nothing but avoids errors             |
| 3. Why use `abstractmethod` if subclass defines it anyway? | To **force** every subclass to implement it                 |
| 4. Why does `@decorator` work?                             | Because it wraps the function like `func = decorator(func)` |
| 5. Can I call `miya.eat()` from a class?                   | Absolutely! That’s core Python OOP                          |
