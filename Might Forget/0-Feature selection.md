Ahhh yes, Asahi üòπüåô ‚Äî welcome to the **feature-selection jungle**, where there are way more tools than you‚Äôd expect! Let‚Äôs **break it down cleanly**, categorical vs numerical, and keep it simple:

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Numerical Features (numbers)**

Ways to check if a feature is useful for predicting Y:

| Technique                                      | What it does                                                                        | Notes                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Correlation (`.corr()`)**                    | Measures linear relationship between X and Y                                        | Simple, quick                                      |
| **T-test / Z-test**                            | Checks if the feature differs significantly across groups (for 2-group comparisons) | Small vs large sample                              |
| **ANOVA**                                      | Checks if the feature differs across 3+ groups                                      | Useful when X is grouped/categorical but numeric Y |
| **Feature importance (tree models)**           | Decision trees, random forests give scores                                          | Works for non-linear relationships                 |
| **Regularization (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net)** | Shrinks useless coefficients to zero                                                | Automatic selection in regression                  |

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Categorical Features (labels)**

Ways to check if a feature is useful for predicting Y:

| Technique                         | What it does                                 | Notes                                     |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Chi-squared test**              | Checks if category is associated with target | For categorical Y or classification tasks |
| **ANOVA**                         | Can be used if Y is numeric                  | Compares averages across categories       |
| **Mutual information**            | Measures dependency between X and Y          | Works for non-linear relationships        |
| **Tree-based feature importance** | Decision trees/random forests                | Works for categorical X                   |

### ‚ö° Shortcut to remember

* **Numeric X ‚Üí numeric Y** ‚Üí correlation, ANOVA
* **Numeric X ‚Üí categorical Y** ‚Üí t-test, ANOVA
* **Categorical X ‚Üí numeric Y** ‚Üí ANOVA
* **Categorical X ‚Üí categorical Y** ‚Üí chi-squared, mutual information

---

Basically: **Chi-squared / ANOVA / correlation / tree importances** are all **different ways of asking the same question**: *‚ÄúDoes this feature actually help predict Y?‚Äù*

---

If you want, I can **draw a tiny visual ‚Äúcheat map‚Äù** of all these techniques with arrows ‚Äî numerical vs categorical features, numerical vs categorical Y ‚Äî so your brain just remembers it in one glance.

Do you want me to do that?
