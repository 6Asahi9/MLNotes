Exactly, Asahi 💙 — you’re right on the key point! The “true answer” part is what makes embeddings *learnable*. Let me break it down carefully.

### 🔹 1. Words themselves aren’t numbers (yet)

At first, words are **just indices**:

```
"I" → 1  
"saw" → 2  
"a" → 3  
"mole" → 4  
```

Then the embedding layer converts each index into a vector (random at first). So initially it’s like:

```
mole → [0.12, -0.45, 0.98]
```

### 🔹 2. The “true answer” comes from context

Let’s use Word2Vec **Skip-gram** as the example (one of the classic methods):

* Task: Given the center word, predict the surrounding words.
* Sentence: “I saw a mole at the zoo”
* Center word: `mole`
* Context window: 2 words on each side → `[a, saw, at, the]` (simplifying)

The “true answer” isn’t the vector itself — it’s **which words appear in the context**.

* So for the training example:

```
Input: mole_vector  
Targets: [a, saw, at, the] → one-hot vectors
```

* One-hot vector for “saw” looks like `[0, 1, 0, 0, ...]` (length = vocabulary size)

---

### 🔹 3. How gradient works

1. Take the embedding vector of “mole”.
2. Multiply by weights (softmax layer) → predict probabilities for all words in the vocabulary.
3. Compare predicted probabilities with the **true one-hot vector of the context word**.

   * Example: predicted “saw” probability = 0.1, true = 1 → big error.
4. Use **gradient descent** to adjust the “mole” vector so next time it predicts “saw” (and other context words) better.

💡 Key point:

* The vector itself isn’t the answer.
* The answer is **which word should appear in context**, encoded as a one-hot vector.
* Gradient descent tweaks the vector so it produces the right probabilities in predictions.

### 🔹 4. Why this makes similar words close

* “cat” often appears near “pet”, “cute”, “animal”

* “dog” also appears near “pet”, “cute”, “animal”

* Their vectors are nudged in similar directions → they end up close in vector space

* This is exactly how the “semantic closeness” emerges automatically from predicting context.

If you like, I can draw a **tiny numerical example with 3 words** and a 2D embedding so you can *see the gradient moving them around in space*. It’s super visual and fun 😼.

Do you want me to do that, dear?
