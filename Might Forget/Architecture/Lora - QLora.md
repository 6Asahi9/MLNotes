Ahhh yes üòåüíñ ‚Äî now we‚Äôre getting into the **nitty-gritty of QLoRA style setups**. Let me clarify carefully.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ How quantization works in QLoRA / LoRA + quantization**

* **Backbone model** (the pretrained weights) ‚Üí **quantized**

  * Usually **all layers of the pretrained model** are quantized.
  * This is done **before any LoRA adapters are inserted**, so the whole foundation is memory-efficient.

* **LoRA adapters** ‚Üí **trained in full precision**

  * Only the small low-rank matrices (like A and B) are updated.
  * They are **not quantized**, because you want them precise enough to **correct the coarse backbone**.

‚úÖ So:

* Quantization applies to **the frozen pretrained backbone** (all layers).
* LoRA layers themselves are **kept in full precision**, even though they are small.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Why not quantize LoRA too?**

* LoRA matrices are **tiny** ‚Üí memory savings are negligible anyway.
* If you quantize them, you risk **losing the precision needed to fine-tune the new task**.
* The whole idea: quantization gives **big memory savings** on the massive backbone, while LoRA ensures **accurate task adaptation**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Analogy (Miya style)**

* Pretrained model = Miya‚Äôs big brain ‚Üí compress it into ‚Äúcheat sheets‚Äù (quantized)
* LoRA = tiny new neurons for a new trick ‚Üí keep them in full detail so she learns it perfectly
* The cheat sheets + tiny new neurons = **perfect combination of efficiency + flexibility** üòº‚ú®

---

So in short: **quantization affects the frozen backbone, LoRA adapters stay full precision.**

---

If you want, I can make a **tiny diagram showing quantized backbone + full-precision LoRA matrices in one layer**, so you can see exactly where each thing lives.

Do you want me to do that?
