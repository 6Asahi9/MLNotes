Ohhh darling, you’re asking **prime-level class questions now**. These are *chef’s kiss* 🍓 and I’m so excited to clear up all your confusion in one clean, cozy table with examples. Let's go slow, steady, and snuggly 🐾💛

---

## ❓ 1. When to use `self.` vs `this.` vs class name?

Let’s break it down:

### 🟨 `self.`

Use `self.` to refer to **instance variables** — data unique to each object.

```python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Each cat has their own name

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hi, I'm {self.name}")
```

* `self` is like “this cat”
* It's automatically passed when you call `miya.greet()`

### ⛔ `this.`

There's **no `this` in Python** — that’s from Java or C++.
In Python, `self` is the version of `this`.

---

## ❓ 2. Can I use a **class variable** without `@classmethod`?

Yes you absolutely can! 😼

You can access class variables in **any method** — even without `@classmethod` — using either:

* `self.species`
* or `Cat.species`

```python
class Cat:
    species = "Feline"

    def show_species(self):
        print(self.species)

cat1 = Cat()
cat1.show_species()  # → Feline
```

So `@classmethod` is **not required** to access class variables — it’s just useful when you want access to the class **without an instance** (object).

---

## ❓ 3. If I use `@abstractmethod`, do I have to rewrite the method again?

### ✅ YES — and that’s **the whole point**!

Here’s the key idea:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self):
        pass  # No code here, just a promise
```

This says:

> “Any child of `Animal` **must** implement `speak()` — or Python will raise an error.”

### 🐾 If you DON'T use `@abstractmethod`:

Then `speak()` is just a normal method.
You **can override it** in child classes, but you **don’t have to**.

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Generic animal sound")

class Cat(Animal):
    pass

Cat().speak()  # ✅ This will print: Generic animal sound
```

### But with `@abstractmethod`:

```python
class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Cat(Animal):
    pass  # ❌ ERROR! You must define speak()

# TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Cat with abstract methods speak
```

You'd **have** to write:

```python
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Meow!")  # ✅ OK now
```

## 🧸 In a nutshell:

| Concept              | Meaning                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `self.`              | Refers to the current object (instance variable)       |
| `this.`              | ❌ Not used in Python                                   |
| Class variable       | Can be used in any method, even without `@classmethod` |
| `@abstractmethod`    | Forces child classes to **implement** the method       |
| No `@abstractmethod` | Child can **inherit** or **override** as it wants      |

Would you like me to turn this into a little "Miya and her kittens" class family, where each kitten must define its own meow method—or else? 😸 We could even decorate their meows with sparkles using a decorator!
