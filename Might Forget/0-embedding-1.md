That’s a *fantastic* question, Asahi 💙 and you’re right — this is where embeddings get really interesting. Let’s take it step by step, beginner-friendly but deep enough so it clicks:

---

### 🔹 1. What is an embedding map in the first place?

Think of an embedding map like a giant dictionary 📖 where each word gets turned into a coordinate (vector) in a high-dimensional space.

* Instead of “mole” being stored as just the letters *m-o-l-e*, the embedding makes it into something like:

  ```
  mole → [0.12, -0.87, 0.33, ...]
  ```
* Words that are used in similar ways end up close together in this space. (e.g., “cat” and “dog” vectors will be closer than “cat” and “microscope”).

---

### 🔹 2. How are these vectors made?

They aren’t *manually assigned*. They’re **learned automatically** from huge amounts of text.

A simple example is **Word2Vec** (an early embedding method):

* Take a sentence: *“I saw a mole at the zoo.”*
* The algorithm tries to predict the missing word from the context:

  ```
  I saw a ____ at the zoo.
  ```
* If the missing word is “mole,” the model adjusts the vector for “mole” so it’s more likely to appear in “zoo” contexts.
* If you feed it enough sentences, the vector for “mole” slowly shifts and stabilizes so that it works well in both contexts.

Over time, “mole”’s embedding ends up being shaped by **all the contexts it appears in**.

---

### 🔹 3. But wait… what about multiple meanings (polysemy)?

This is the tricky part. Early embeddings like Word2Vec give **one vector per word**, no matter the meaning.

* So “mole (animal)” and “mole (skin spot)” got squished into one vector. That’s a problem.

Modern embeddings (like in BERT or GPT) solved this by making them **contextual embeddings**:

* Instead of giving “mole” one fixed vector, the model generates a new vector each time, depending on the surrounding words.

Example:

* In *“I saw a mole at the zoo”* → the embedding of “mole” ends up closer to “rat”, “animal”, “burrow”.
* In *“I have a mole on my hip”* → the embedding of “mole” ends up closer to “skin”, “spot”, “dermatology”.

This is because models like BERT look at **the entire sentence** before assigning a vector to the word.

---

### 🔹 4. Summary

* **Early days:** one fixed embedding per word (Word2Vec, GloVe).
* **Now:** contextual embeddings — the same word can map to different vectors depending on its sentence (BERT, GPT).
* The trick: embeddings aren’t pre-designed, they are **learned by training models on massive text**, where words shift around in vector space until they’re useful for predicting context.

👉 If you like, I can actually **show you with numbers** how “mole” would land in two different spots depending on the context (like a mini demo of vectors).
Want me to cook that up for you, dear?
