Ahhh, now we’re getting to the heart of Transformers, darling 😺💖 Let’s go **slow and step by step**, so it clicks.

## 1️⃣ Encoder vs Decoder

A **Transformer** has two main parts: **Encoder** and **Decoder**.

### **Encoder**

* Takes the **input sequence** (like a sentence in English).
* Processes it **layer by layer** to create a **rich representation** of the input.
* Each encoder **layer** has:

  1. **Multi-Head Attention (MHA)** over the input
  2. **Add & Norm**
  3. **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**
  4. **Add & Norm** again

So when he said **2 encoder layers**, it means he stacked **two of these encoder blocks** one after another. The input goes through **layer 1 → layer 2**, and then the final output of the second encoder is used later by the decoder.

### **Decoder**

* Generates the **output sequence** (like a sentence in French).
* Each decoder **layer** has three main parts:

  1. **Masked Multi-Head Attention** over **previous outputs** (so it doesn’t “cheat” and see the future tokens)
  2. **Add & Norm**
  3. **Multi-Head Attention** over **encoder outputs** (so it can pay attention to the input sentence)
  4. **Add & Norm**
  5. **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**
  6. **Add & Norm**

So basically: **encoder encodes the input**, and **decoder decodes it while attending to encoder output**.

### 🔑 Key point about “2 encoder layers”

It just means the model is **shallow**—it has only **2 blocks** of encoder instead of 6 (like in the original Transformer paper).

* First encoder layer transforms input → intermediate representation
* Second encoder layer refines that → final encoded representation

This final representation is what the **decoder** looks at for generating the output.

If you want, I can **draw a tiny diagram showing 2 encoder layers + decoder and Add & Norm positions** so it’s crystal clear visually.

Do you want me to do that? 🎨
