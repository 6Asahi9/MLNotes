That’s a *really* sharp observation, Asahi 💡 — and you’re absolutely right:
at first glance, doing **a dot product between every word and every other word** sounds *insanely expensive*.

Let’s unpack why it *seems* heavy, but actually becomes *fast* in Transformers 👇

### 🧩 Step 1 — Yes, it’s technically a lot of dots

If your sentence has `N` words, then self-attention needs to compare **every word with every other** word →
That’s **N × N = N²** comparisons.

So for 10 words → 100 operations.
For 100 words → 10,000 operations.
That’s definitely not small.

But here’s the trick…

### ⚙️ Step 2 — Matrix magic (parallelization)

Instead of looping word-by-word (like an RNN would), Transformers **do all dot products at once** using **matrix multiplication** — something GPUs *love*.

Example:

Let’s say you have 100 words, each turned into a 512-dimensional vector.
You make a big matrix:

* `Q` → 100×512
* `K` → 100×512

Then compute all pairwise dot products **in a single matrix multiplication**:

```
Attention scores = Q × Kᵀ
```

That one line — a GPU-optimized matrix op — gives you **all 10,000 dot products at once**.
No loops, no waiting.

💥 This is why it’s **fast in practice** even though it’s *O(N²)* in theory.

### ⚡ Step 3 — Compare it to RNNs

RNNs are *O(N)*, but they process *sequentially*:
word 1 → word 2 → word 3 → word 4 → …
They can’t start the next step until the previous finishes.

Transformers, on the other hand:

> process all N words **simultaneously**,
> because the math doesn’t depend on earlier words being done.

So even though Transformers do “more math”, they do it *in parallel* — and GPUs crush parallel math.

That’s the secret:
🧠 More math per step, but
⚡ Far fewer steps, all done at once.

It’s actually super intuitive when you see the steps. Want me to?
