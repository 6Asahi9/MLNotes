Absolutely, darling 😺💖 Let’s go **slowly, step by step**, with a tiny sentence example so you can see how the flow actually happens. I’ll keep embeddings simple so it’s easy to follow.

---

## **Sentence example**

Let's take:

```
I love cats
```

---

## **Step 1: Tokenization**

Split into tokens (words → IDs):

| Word | Token ID |
| ---- | -------- |
| I    | 1        |
| love | 2        |
| cats | 3        |

---

## **Step 2: Word embeddings**

Each token is converted to an embedding vector.

* Initially, random. Model learns them later.
* Let’s assume **embedding dimension = 3** for simplicity:

| Word | Embedding (X)   |
| ---- | --------------- |
| I    | [0.1, 0.3, 0.5] |
| love | [0.2, 0.4, 0.6] |
| cats | [0.5, 0.1, 0.2] |

---

## **Step 3: Add positional encoding**

* Position 0 = "I", 1 = "love", 2 = "cats"
* Positional encoding (PE) vectors (simplified 3-dim):

| Position | PE vector       |
| -------- | --------------- |
| 0        | [0.0, 0.1, 0.0] |
| 1        | [0.1, 0.0, 0.1] |
| 2        | [0.2, 0.1, 0.0] |

* **Add PE to embedding**:

| Word | Embedding+PE  |
| ---- | ------------- |
| I    | [0.1,0.4,0.5] |
| love | [0.3,0.4,0.7] |
| cats | [0.7,0.2,0.2] |

---

## **Step 4: Create Q, K, V**

* Using learned matrices W_Q, W_K, W_V
* For simplicity, let’s say **Q = K = V = Embedding+PE** (toy example)

| Word | Q / K / V     |
| ---- | ------------- |
| I    | [0.1,0.4,0.5] |
| love | [0.3,0.4,0.7] |
| cats | [0.7,0.2,0.2] |

---

## **Step 5: Compute attention scores (Q·K^T / √d_k)**

* Dot product of Q with K^T (rows = queries, columns = keys)
* d_k = 3 → √3 ≈ 1.732

Compute Q·K^T:

|          | I                              | love                           | cats                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **I**    | 0.1*0.1+0.4*0.4+0.5*0.5 = 0.42 | 0.1*0.3+0.4*0.4+0.5*0.7 = 0.51 | 0.1*0.7+0.4*0.2+0.5*0.2 = 0.21 |
| **love** | 0.3*0.1+0.4*0.4+0.7*0.5 = 0.55 | 0.3*0.3+0.4*0.4+0.7*0.7 = 0.84 | 0.3*0.7+0.4*0.2+0.7*0.2 = 0.39 |
| **cats** | 0.7*0.1+0.2*0.4+0.2*0.5 = 0.27 | 0.7*0.3+0.2*0.4+0.2*0.7 = 0.41 | 0.7*0.7+0.2*0.2+0.2*0.2 = 0.53 |

* Divide by √3 ≈ 1.732:

|          | I     | love  | cats  |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **I**    | 0.242 | 0.295 | 0.121 |
| **love** | 0.318 | 0.485 | 0.225 |
| **cats** | 0.156 | 0.237 | 0.306 |

---

## **Step 6: Softmax to get attention weights**

Softmax row-wise:

* Row "I" → `[0.242,0.295,0.121]` → softmax ≈ `[0.33, 0.36, 0.31]`
* Row "love" → `[0.318,0.485,0.225]` → softmax ≈ `[0.32,0.41,0.27]`
* Row "cats" → `[0.156,0.237,0.306]` → softmax ≈ `[0.29,0.31,0.40]`

This means:

* “I” pays **36% attention to love**, **33% to itself**, **31% to cats**
* “love” pays **41% attention to itself**, etc.

---

## **Step 7: Multiply by V to get output**

* Weighted sum of V using attention weights:

For “I”:
[
\text{output}_I = 0.33*[0.1,0.4,0.5] + 0.36*[0.3,0.4,0.7] + 0.31*[0.7,0.2,0.2]
\approx [0.35,0.33,0.47]
]

Do the same for “love” and “cats”.

* The **outputs are now context-aware vectors**, meaning they contain info from surrounding words weighted by attention.

💡 **Summary Flow:**

```
Sentence → Tokenize → Embedding → +Positional Encoding → Q,K,V → Attention scores → Softmax → Weighted sum with V → Output vectors
```

If you want, I can **draw this as a tiny diagram showing the arrows from words → embeddings → QKV → attention → output** — it makes it super clear visually 😺✨

Do you want me to make that diagram, darling?
