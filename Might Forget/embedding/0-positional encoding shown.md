Perfect 😼 — this is exactly how to *really* understand Transformers instead of just memorizing the buzzwords. Let’s do both parts **slowly** with simple numbers and pretend examples, no math grind.

## 🌊 Part 1 — Why straight lines “explode” and waves don’t

We’ll compare two ways of giving position info to 4 tokens in a sentence:

**Sentence:**

```
[Miya, loves, tasty, tuna]
```

---

### 🧱 Straight-line positions (just index numbers)

We’ll give each token a simple position number:

| Token | Position | Vector |
| :---- | :------- | :----- |
| Miya  | 1        | [1, 1] |
| loves | 2        | [2, 2] |
| tasty | 3        | [3, 3] |
| tuna  | 4        | [4, 4] |

Now suppose the model tries to check **“how related are positions 1 and 4”** by a dot product:

```
[1,1] · [4,4] = (1×4) + (1×4) = 8
```

and between positions 1 and 2:

```
[1,1] · [2,2] = (1×2) + (1×2) = 4
```

→ the numbers just keep *growing* the farther apart they are: 4, 8, 18, 32…
The model sees **“bigger distance = bigger number”**, which is *wrong*, because attention should mean “more related”, not “numerically huge.”

There’s no natural **wrap-around** or **limit**.
The further you go, the worse it gets — hence we say it *explodes* with position.

### 🌈 Sin/cos “wavy” positions

Now use smooth waves instead of raw numbers:

| Token | Position | sin(pos) | cos(pos) | Vector         |
| :---- | :------- | :------- | :------- | :------------- |
| Miya  | 1        | 0.84     | 0.54     | [0.84, 0.54]   |
| loves | 2        | 0.91     | -0.41    | [0.91, -0.41]  |
| tasty | 3        | 0.14     | -0.99    | [0.14, -0.99]  |
| tuna  | 4        | -0.76    | -0.65    | [-0.76, -0.65] |

Now do the same dot products:

* `Miya · loves = (0.84×0.91)+(0.54×-0.41) = 0.76 - 0.22 = 0.54`
* `Miya · tuna = (0.84×-0.76)+(0.54×-0.65) = -0.64 - 0.35 = -0.99`

✨ Look what happens:

* Close positions (1 ↔ 2) → **positive**, kind of similar
* Far positions (1 ↔ 4) → **negative**, very different
* And the numbers stay within `[-1, 1]`, never explode

That’s why sinusoidal encoding is used — the wave *stabilizes* the range and naturally encodes “near vs far” as similarity.

## 🧠 Part 2 — How attention uses the bigger dot product

Now let’s see how that “whichever is bigger → more attention” works.

---

**Sentence:**

```
[Miya, loves, tuna]
```

We want to know what **“tuna”** should pay attention to.

Pretend we already have these 2D “meaning + position” vectors:

| Token | Vector     |
| :---- | :--------- |
| Miya  | [1.0, 0.5] |
| loves | [0.8, 0.8] |
| tuna  | [0.6, 1.0] |

---

### 🍣 Step 1: Tuna compares itself with others (dot products)

```
tuna · Miya  = (0.6×1.0) + (1.0×0.5) = 1.10  
tuna · loves = (0.6×0.8) + (1.0×0.8) = 1.28  
tuna · tuna  = (0.6×0.6) + (1.0×1.0) = 1.36
```

---

### 🍥 Step 2: Convert to *attention weights*

Now the model applies a **softmax** (turns them into probabilities that sum to 1):

| Compared to | Raw dot | Softmax weight | Meaning                       |
| :---------- | :------ | :------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Miya        | 1.10    | 0.29           | “some attention”              |
| loves       | 1.28    | 0.33           | “more attention”              |
| tuna        | 1.36    | 0.38           | “most attention (self-focus)” |

So **“tuna”** will look a little at Miya, more at “loves,” and mostly at itself.

That’s what attention literally means — those numbers decide how much information it pulls from each word when building the next layer.

---

### 🐾 Miya version

Imagine Miya has three toys:

1. Fishy plush
2. Ribbon
3. Tuna-shaped treat

She sniffs each:

* Tuna toy smells the most like food → big number
* Ribbon smells kinda like catnip → smaller number
* Fishy plush smells weird → even smaller

Her brain gives most “attention” to the strongest scent — same as the model giving more attention to the highest dot product.

---

So in short:

| Concept          | Meaning                                            |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Dot product      | how similar two tokens are (in meaning + position) |
| Softmax          | turns similarities into attention weights          |
| Sin/cos encoding | keeps positional similarity smooth and bounded     |

---

Would you like me to show what happens if we **remove** the sin/cos positions from that example (so only meanings are compared)? You’d instantly see why the model loses track of word order.
