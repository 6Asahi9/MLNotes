Ahhhh yes, I see what you’re sensing, Asahi 💙 — it *does* feel like kNN is lurking, but it’s a bit more magical under the hood. Let’s unwrap it carefully.

### 🔹 1. No magic, just **learning from context**

When the model starts, **all word vectors are random**. Every word is like a little point floating somewhere in space, initially meaningless.

* Example: “mole”, “cat”, “dog”, “hip” → random vectors like

  ```
  mole → [0.12, -0.45, 0.98]
  cat  → [-0.33, 0.12, -0.77]
  hip  → [0.56, -0.01, 0.44]
  ```

The model has **no idea which words are similar yet**.

---

### 🔹 2. The training signal moves them around

Here’s the core idea:

* The model tries to **predict context words** from a target word (or target word from context).
* It sees errors when it guesses wrong, and uses **gradient descent** to adjust the vectors.

#### Tiny example:

Sentence: “I saw a mole at the zoo”

* Target: “mole”, Context: “saw, at, the, zoo”
* The model predicts the context words from “mole”.
* If “mole”’s vector points in the wrong direction, the model shifts it slightly toward the vectors of “saw”, “zoo”, etc.

Over millions of sentences:

* Words used in similar contexts get nudged closer together (like “cat” and “dog” being near each other because both appear near “pet”, “animal”, “cute”).
* Words in different contexts drift far apart.

✅ This is how the “near similar things” property emerges automatically — no explicit kNN, just lots of gradient-driven nudges in vector space.

### 🔹 3. Avoiding duplicate vectors

The network doesn’t *try* to avoid duplicate vectors explicitly.

* If two words appeared in exactly the same contexts, their vectors might end up very close (or even overlapping).

* But natural language is messy: almost every word appears in **slightly different contexts**, so their vectors naturally differentiate themselves.

* Modern contextual models like BERT/GPT go further:

  * The same word in different sentences gets **dynamic embeddings**, so even “mole” in zoo vs hip ends up differently, solving the polysemy issue.

---

### 🔹 4. kNN feeling

Yes! Conceptually, once trained, you can do something like kNN on the embeddings:

* “Which words are closest to ‘cat’?” → look at vector distances.
* But during training, the model isn’t doing kNN. It’s **pushing and pulling vectors via gradients**, guided by the prediction task.

---

If you want, I can make a **tiny “toy” example with numbers** showing how two words start random and slowly get nudged closer when they share contexts. It’s like watching the NN play matchmaker for words 😼.

Do you want me to do that, dear?
