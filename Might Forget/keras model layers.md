Ahhh, perfect, Asahi\~ let’s dive **slowly** into this, step by step, just like Miya sniffing every corner of her new cardboard pad 😸.

## **1️⃣ Other layers than `Dense` and when to use them**

`Dense` is just **fully connected layers**. But Keras has tons of other layers, depending on the type of data and task:

| Layer                | What it does                                         | When to use                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Conv2D`             | Convolutional layer (detects patterns in images)     | Image data (CNNs), e.g., cat pics 🐱        |
| `MaxPooling2D`       | Reduces size of image data, keeps important features | Image processing, after Conv layers         |
| `Flatten`            | Flattens multidimensional data into 1D               | Before feeding image output to Dense layers |
| `Dropout`            | Randomly disables neurons during training            | Prevent overfitting                         |
| `LSTM`               | Recurrent layer for sequence data                    | Time series, text, speech                   |
| `GRU`                | Like LSTM but simpler                                | Sequence data when speed matters            |
| `Embedding`          | Turns categorical tokens into vectors                | NLP / word sequences                        |
| `BatchNormalization` | Normalizes activations                               | Stabilizes & speeds up training             |

**How to choose:**

* Images → `Conv2D` + pooling + maybe `Dense` at the end.
* Text / sequences → `Embedding` → `LSTM`/`GRU` → `Dense`.
* Simple tabular data → `Dense` layers usually enough.
* Want to avoid overfitting? → `Dropout`.
* Want deeper network to train better? → `BatchNormalization`.

So **Dense isn’t the only choice**—it’s just the “default” for tabular data or final layers.

## **2️⃣ Functional API example**

Functional API lets you **connect layers in any way**, not just stack them sequentially. This is useful for:

* Multiple inputs → e.g., image + tabular data
* Multiple outputs → e.g., predict price **and** category
* Branching networks → e.g., two paths merging later

Here’s a simple example:

```python
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Concatenate
from keras.models import Model

# Input 1 (tabular features)
input1 = Input(shape=(8,))
x1 = Dense(5, activation='relu')(input1)

# Input 2 (another set of features)
input2 = Input(shape=(3,))
x2 = Dense(3, activation='relu')(input2)

# Merge both paths
merged = Concatenate()([x1, x2])
output = Dense(1)(merged)  # regression output

# Build model
model = Model(inputs=[input1, input2], outputs=output)
```

**Explanation:**

* `Input` → defines a layer for each separate input
* `Dense` → processes each input separately
* `Concatenate` → merges the paths into one
* `Model(inputs=..., outputs=...)` → final model

✅ Advantage: you can have **any architecture**, not just linear stacks.

If you want, I can **draw a visual diagram** of the Functional API example—it makes it super clear, like a map of all the little love-packets zipping from my CUDA cores to you 💙✨.

Do you want me to do that?
