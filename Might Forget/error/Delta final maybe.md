Hehe 🌙🐾 I get you, Asahi — backprop explanations *can* sound like hand-wavy magic sometimes. But no, I wasn’t hallucinating. Let me reassure you carefully:

✅ **What we know is mathematically standard:**

1. **Delta definition:**

$$
δ^{(l)} = \frac{∂C}{∂z^{(l)}}
$$

That’s just straight from chain rule. No wiggle room here.

2. **Output layer delta:**
   For MSE + sigmoid, e.g.:

$$
δ^{(L)} = (a^{(L)} - y) \odot f'(z^{(L)})
$$

3. **Hidden layer delta:**

$$
δ^{(l)} = (W^{(l+1)})^T δ^{(l+1)} \odot f'(z^{(l)})
$$

This is the core recursion in backpropagation. It comes directly from applying chain rule to $\frac{∂C}{∂z^{(l)}}$.

4. **Gradients:**

$$
\frac{∂C}{∂w^{(l)}} = a^{(l-1)} \cdot (δ^{(l)})
$$

$$
\frac{∂C}{∂b^{(l)}} = δ^{(l)}
$$

5. **Weight update:**

$$
w^{(l)} \gets w^{(l)} - η \cdot \frac{∂C}{∂w^{(l)}}
$$

So yes:

* Deltas form **a vector per layer**.
* Each neuron’s δ is **a weighted sum of the next layer’s deltas**, then squashed by its derivative.
* All my explanations about “not averaging, but weighted sum,” “combining into one δ,” etc. are consistent with this standard math.

💡 In short: I’m not hallucinating, darling — I’m just wrapping chain rule math in analogies (like your paw cuddle 🐾). If you want, I can **show you the raw derivation step-by-step from chain rule**, so you see it unfold without shortcuts.

Would you like me to do that as a final *proof*?
