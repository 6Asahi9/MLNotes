Perfect question üëè You‚Äôve just touched the exact bridge between the **math formulas** (those derivatives $\frac{\partial C}{\partial W}, \frac{\partial C}{\partial b}, \frac{\partial C}{\partial a^{(L-1)}}$) and the **error signals (the deltas)** I showed in the worked example. Let‚Äôs line them up step by step.

---

## 1. The ‚Äúerror signal‚Äù ($\delta$)

When we backprop, we define for each neuron $j$ in layer $l$ an error signal:

$$
\delta_j^{(l)} = \frac{\partial C}{\partial z_j^{(l)}}
$$

where $z_j^{(l)}$ is the pre-activation (the weighted sum before activation function).

That‚Äôs literally ‚Äúhow much does changing this neuron‚Äôs input shift the cost.‚Äù
This is the **$\delta$** values I computed for outputs and hidden neurons in the example.

---

## 2. How $\delta$ connects to gradients

Once you have $\delta$, the other derivatives fall into place:

* **Weights**:

$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial W_{ij}^{(l)}} = a_i^{(l-1)} \cdot \delta_j^{(l)}
$$

Each weight gradient is just ‚Äúactivation from previous layer‚Äù √ó ‚Äúerror signal of current neuron.‚Äù

* **Biases**:

$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial b_j^{(l)}} = \delta_j^{(l)}
$$

Bias gradient is just the error signal itself.

* **Activations from previous layer**:

$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial a_i^{(l-1)}} = \sum_j W_{ij}^{(l)} \cdot \delta_j^{(l)}
$$

This is what lets you propagate the error signal backwards.

## 3. Where $\delta$ comes from

* At the **output layer**:

$$
\delta_j^{(L)} = \frac{\partial C}{\partial a_j^{(L)}} \cdot \sigma'(z_j^{(L)})
$$

For MSE + linear activation, $\sigma'(z)=1$, so it was just $\frac{2}{n}(y_j - t_j)$.

* At a **hidden layer**:

$$
\delta^{(l)} = \big( (W^{(l+1)})^T \delta^{(l+1)} \big) \odot \sigma'(z^{(l)})
$$

(‚äô means elementwise multiply). This is the ‚Äúweighted sum of next layer‚Äôs error signals‚Äù I showed.

---

## 4. Putting it together

So:

* The **error signal** $\delta$ *is* the quantity that makes $\frac{\partial C}{\partial W}$, $\frac{\partial C}{\partial b}$, and $\frac{\partial C}{\partial a^{(l-1)}}$ easy to compute.
* Instead of directly trying to differentiate the loss wrt everything, you first compute $\delta$ and then plug it into those simple formulas.

---

‚ú® TL;DR:
The error signal is **$\delta = \frac{\partial C}{\partial z}$**.
It‚Äôs the engine of backprop ‚Äî once you know $\delta$, you can immediately compute all the things you listed:

* $dC/dW = a^{(prev)} \cdot \delta$
* $dC/db = \delta$
* $dC/da(prev) = W^T \delta$

---

Want me to **redo the worked 2-layer example**, but this time explicitly labeling everything as $dC/dW$, $dC/db$, $dC/da^{(l-1)}$ using those deltas, so you see the exact mapping?
