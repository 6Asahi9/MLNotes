Absolutely, Asahi üòºüíñ Let‚Äôs go **step by step**, nice and clear. I‚Äôll also connect **MSE** to OLS so it clicks.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**

* **What it is:**
  A **linear regression method** that finds the line (or hyperplane) that **minimizes the sum of squared differences** between predicted and actual values.

* **Formula:**

$$
\text{Loss (SSE)} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

* **Goal:** Minimize the squared errors ‚Üí best-fit line.

* **Pros:** Simple, mathematically exact solution.

* **Cons:** Sensitive to outliers, doesn‚Äôt scale well for huge datasets.

* **Connection to MSE:**
  **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** is basically the **average of the squared errors**. OLS minimizes the **sum of squared errors**, so minimizing MSE or SSE gives the same weights.

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

‚úÖ So yes, MSE is basically the ‚Äúleast squares‚Äù concept, just averaged.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Gradient Descent**

* **What it is:**
  An **optimization algorithm** to find weights that minimize a loss function (like MSE).

* **Idea:**

  * Start with random weights
  * Compute gradient (slope) of loss w\.r.t weights
  * Move weights **opposite to the gradient** ‚Üí reduces error
  * Repeat until convergence

* **Formula:**

$$
w = w - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}
$$

* **Pros:** Works for **large datasets**, non-linear models, neural networks.
* **Cons:** Needs careful tuning of **learning rate ($\eta$)**, may converge slowly.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**

* **What it is:**
  A **variant of gradient descent**.

* **Difference from normal gradient descent:**

  * Standard gradient descent computes gradient **over the entire dataset** ‚Üí slow for large data.
  * SGD computes gradient **using one sample (or a mini-batch) at a time** ‚Üí faster updates.

* **Pros:** Faster for big data, can escape local minima due to randomness.

* **Cons:** More noisy updates ‚Üí may need **learning rate decay or averaging**.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

* **What it is:**
  A **dimensionality reduction technique**.

  * Finds **new axes (principal components)** that capture **maximum variance** in the data.
  * Projects original data onto these axes ‚Üí fewer dimensions but most of the information preserved.

* **Use cases:**

  * Reducing features for visualization
  * Removing redundancy in correlated features
  * Preprocessing before ML algorithms

* **Conceptual formula:**

  * Compute **covariance matrix** of data
  * Find **eigenvectors/eigenvalues** ‚Üí principal components
  * Project data onto top-k components

If you want, I can make a **tiny Miya-themed visual** showing OLS, GD, SGD, and PCA in action‚Äîlike predicting her happiness based on tuna, nap time, and play, so it sticks better üò∏‚ú®.

Do you want me to do that?
