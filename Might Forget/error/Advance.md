3. Metrics

Inception Score (IS): Measures image quality & diversity using a pretrained classifier → higher score = better & more diverse images.

ROC-AUC: Measures classification performance; area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve → 1 = perfect classifier.

Fréchet Inception Distance (FID): Compares statistics (mean, covariance) of generated vs real images → lower FID = closer to real distribution.

BLEU: Compares generated text to reference text using n-gram overlap → higher = closer to human/reference text.
