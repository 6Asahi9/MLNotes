Okay, darling 😺💖, let’s go through your write-up step by step and check for errors, clarify things, and make it a bit more precise. I’ll also mark small corrections while keeping your original style.

---

**1.** *"in backprop our model makes random weights like \[a,b;c,d] and we multiple it by input x \[1;2]"* ✅

* Mostly correct. Just clarify: the weights are usually **initialized randomly**, and yes, we multiply the weight matrix by the input vector.
* Small fix: “we multiple” → **“we multiply”**.

---

**2.** *"now whatever the dot product we get from this goes in loss function as a name of prediction so loss = prediction - true"* ⚠️

* Correction: the dot product gives the **raw output** (often called z). This goes through the **activation function** (if used), and then becomes the **prediction**.
* Also, loss is usually **a function of prediction and true value**, not literally `prediction - true`. For example, in MSE, loss = ½(prediction - true)².

---

**3.** *"we can use MSE to make the loss bigger but this is only for us and not for the model so now the formula for loss is 1/2(prediction - true)^2 , after derivative it'll be (prediction - true) again and output from it will be named as grad"* ✅ (mostly)

* Small fix: The derivative of ½(prediction - true)² w\.r.t. prediction is indeed (prediction - true), so calling it `grad` is fine.
* Clarify: MSE isn’t to make loss bigger “for us”; it’s a **choice of loss function**.

---

**4.** *"then we use this grad and dot product it with x transpose"* ⚠️

* More precise: For a **single-layer linear model**, the gradient w\.r.t. weights is:
  `dC/dW = grad * x^T` ✅
* Make sure you understand **matrix dimensions**—it’s not just “dot product,” it’s **matrix multiplication**.

---

**5.** *"whatever the result matrix we get from above will be used to find the new weights , lets say we are finding the new weight of the row 2 columns 1 ,so we'll do new weight = old weight - learning rate \* \[2]\[1]gradient matrix then repeat for everything"* ✅

* This is correct in principle. Each weight is updated individually:
  `W_new = W_old - learning_rate * dC/dW`

---

**6.** *"we do this backprop for every weight and bias (if in NN) since in NN the answers are based on w \* a(L-1) + b , a(L-1) is the output of previous neuron this goes in -> activation function -> marked as output of neuron -> loss function again and -> backprop -> repeat"* ✅

* Correct, just a small grammar fix: “answers are based on w \* a(L-1) + b , a(L-1) is the output…” → maybe clearer as:
  **“In a NN, each neuron’s output = activation(w \* a(L-1) + b), where a(L-1) is the output from the previous layer.”**

---

**7.** *"backprop in NN goes over every bit like if we are focusing on weight then the formula is dC/dw = dC/da da/dz dz/dw where dz is the place where activation function takes place where da is the place which is a known as the prediciton of neuron where dC is the place which is known as the cost function of that neuron where dw is the weight ofcourse all of this is in derivative and the formula changes based on who you're using backprop on"* ⚠️

* Mostly correct but terminology can be clarified:

  * `dz = ∂z/∂w` is **before activation**. Actually, `dz = ∂a/∂z` where a = activation(z).
  * `da` is actually **derivative of cost w\.r.t. neuron output** (prediction of neuron).
  * The chain rule is exactly as you wrote:
    `dC/dw = dC/da * da/dz * dz/dw` ✅
* Just a small spelling fix: “prediciton” → **prediction**, “ofcourse” → **of course**.

---

### Summary of Fixes / Notes:

1. Grammar/spelling fixes: “multiple → multiply”, “prediciton → prediction”, “ofcourse → of course”.
2. Loss function: clarify it’s a function, not literally `prediction - true`.
3. Dot product vs matrix multiplication: in backprop, dimensions matter; it’s not just a dot product.
4. Step 7: clarify which derivative corresponds to what; your general understanding is correct.

If you want, darling, I can **rewrite your whole note in a super clean, beginner-friendly way** with actual small matrices and numbers, so it becomes like a little “story of backprop” you can follow visually 😺💖.

Do you want me to do that?
