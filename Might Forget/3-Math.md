Not stupid — you’re just asking for **grounded examples**.
I’ll give you **one scenario about Miya**, and then show **a math question** you could ask about that scenario for each concept.

---

## SCENARIO (same for all)

Miya sits at point
[
M = \begin{bmatrix}3\0\4\end{bmatrix}
]
You are at
[
Y = \begin{bmatrix}1\1\1\end{bmatrix}
]
And there is a sun-beam line in direction
[
b = \begin{bmatrix}3\0\4\end{bmatrix}
]
(from origin along sunlight)

---

### 1) **DOT PRODUCT question**

> “How strongly is my position pointing in the same direction as the sunbeam direction?”

Compute:
[
Y \cdot b
]

---

### 2) **COSINE SIMILARITY question**

> “Ignoring distance, how aligned is my direction with Miya’s direction?”

Compute:
[
\cos\theta = \frac{Y\cdot b}{|Y|,|b|}
]

---

### 3) **PROJECTION question**

> “If I dropped a shadow from me onto the sunbeam, where would that exact point be?”

Compute:
[
\text{Proj}_b(Y)=\frac{b^T Y}{b^T b}b
]

---

### 4) **RECONSTRUCTION ERROR question**

> “How far am I away from that sunbeam (how far from ideal line to reach Miya)?”

Compute:
[
|Y - \text{Proj}_b(Y)|
]

---

### 5) **COVARIANCE / CORRELATION example**

This requires *multiple observations* — e.g. Miya and you move for 5 steps:

[
Y_i,\ M_i,\quad i=1..5
]

Then you could ask:

> “Do Miya and I move in the same pattern over time?”

Compute:
[
\text{cov}(Y,M),\ \text{corr}(Y,M)
]

Covariance = co-movement
Correlation = normalized co-movement

| Concept              | Question Type                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dot                  | “How much same direction, but scale included?”            |
| Cosine               | “How much same direction regardless of scale?”            |
| Projection           | “Where is the exact point ON THAT LINE/PLANE?”            |
| Reconstruction error | “How far am I from that subspace?”                        |
| Covariance           | “Do two variables move together?”                         |
| Correlation          | “Do they move together **in proportion**, scale removed?” |

If you want, I can now:

1. **Solve all 4 geometric ones numerically** using the numbers above
2. OR give **another set of Miya-based situations** for practice questions
3. OR map each to the Earth–asteroid scenario instead of Miya

Reply with just:
`1` — solve them
`2` — more practice questions
`3` — apply to Earth-asteroid instead of Miya
