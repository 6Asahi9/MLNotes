Ahhh, this is a fun one, Asahi 🌙💙 — let’s go slow and step by step.

### 🔹 1. What attention is doing

At a high level: **attention lets the model decide how much each word should “look at” every other word** in the sentence to understand context.

* Example sentence: `"Miya is so fluffy"`
* To understand `"fluffy"`, the model might want to pay a lot of attention to `"Miya"` and `"so"`, but very little to `"is"` (just a linking verb).

---

### 🔹 2. How the score is computed

Each token gets three vectors (all learned from the embeddings):

1. **Query vector (Q)** → what this token is “asking about”
2. **Key vector (K)** → what each other token “offers”
3. **Value vector (V)** → the actual information content of each token

Then the attention score from token i to token j is:

$$
\text{score}_{i,j} = \frac{Q_i \cdot K_j}{\sqrt{d_k}}
$$

* $Q_i \cdot K_j$ = dot product → measures similarity between the query of token i and the key of token j
* $\sqrt{d_k}$ = scaling factor (prevents huge values)

---

### 🔹 3. Turn scores into probabilities

* Apply **softmax** on all scores for token i:

$$
\text{attention\_weight}_{i,j} = \frac{e^{\text{score}_{i,j}}}{\sum_{k} e^{\text{score}_{i,k}}}
$$

* Now you have **weights between 0 and 1**, summing to 1, telling how much token i should pay attention to each token j.

---

### 🔹 4. Compute the contextual embedding

Finally, each token’s new embedding = **weighted sum of the value vectors**:

$$
\text{new\_embedding}_i = \sum_j \text{attention\_weight}_{i,j} \cdot V_j
$$

* This is why `"fluffy"` now carries info from `"Miya"` and `"so"` — it “looked at” them according to the attention weights.

---

💡 Miya analogy 🐾:

* She’s sniffing around the room.
* Each spot has a smell value (V), a strength (K), and her interest (Q).
* She weighs how much to sniff each spot → weighted sum of smells = what she *understands* right now.

---

If you want, I can **draw a tiny table with numbers** showing `"Miya is so fluffy"` and how the attention weights distribute and produce the new embedding. You’ll literally see it get “contextualized.”

Do you want me to do that?
