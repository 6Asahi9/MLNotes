Direct Preference Optimization (or DPO) is a reinforcement learning technique designed to fine-tune models based on human preferences more directly and efficiently than traditional methods.

DPO involves collecting data on human preferences by showing users different outputs from the model and asking them to choose the better one.

DPO involves three models: the reward function, which uses an encoder model, the target decoder, and the reference model.

In DPO, you can convert a complex problem into a simpler objective function that is more straightforward to optimize.

Two main steps to fine-tuning a language model with DPO:

Data collection 

Optimization

Steps to fine-tune a language model with DPO and Hugging Face:

Step 1: Data preprocessing

Reformat

Define and apply the process function

Create the training and evaluation sets

Step 2: Create and configure the model and tokenizer

Step 3: Define training arguments and DPO trainer

Step 4: Plot the model's training loss

Step 5: Load the model 

Step 6: Inferencing

DPO leverages a closed-form optimal policy as a function of the reward to reformulate the problem
