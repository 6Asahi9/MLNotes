### **Glossary of Terms**

**Argmax / Argmin** – The argument of the maximum/minimum of a function; the input value that yields the highest/lowest output.

**AutoModelForCausalLM** – A Hugging Face class to load pre-trained causal language models (e.g., GPT-2) for text generation.

**Beam search** – A search algorithm that expands the most promising sequences of tokens at each step to improve sequence generation quality.

**Beta (β) parameter** – A hyperparameter controlling the balance between the current policy and the reference model; in DPO, it acts as the temperature parameter for the loss.

**Bradley-Terry model** – A probabilistic model for ranking and comparing items via pairwise preferences.

**Dataset** – A collection of data used for training, validating, and testing ML models.

**Dataset tokenization** – Converting raw text into token IDs that ML models can process.

**Direct preference optimization (DPO)** – An optimization technique using pairwise comparisons instead of explicit rewards to train models.

**Distribution (in ML)** – Shows all possible values of a dataset and their frequencies; in LMs, it’s the probability distribution of possible responses.

**Inference** – Using a trained model to make predictions or generate outputs on new input data.

**Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence** – Measures how one probability distribution diverges from a reference; used in RL to keep new policy close to old policy.

**Language model** – Predicts the probability of a sequence of words; used for text generation.

**LengthSampler** – Varies text lengths during processing to simulate realistic input conditions.

**Log-derivative trick** – A method to calculate gradients of functions in expectation form, used in RL for policy optimization.

**Loss function** – Measures the difference between predicted and target outcomes, guiding optimization.

**Max and min tokens** – Parameters controlling the length of generated sequences in language models.

**Objective function** – Represents the goal of an optimization problem, guiding model improvement.

**Omega (ω) function** – Notation describing detailed policy distributions in RL based on previous tokens.

**Optimization** – Adjusting model parameters to improve performance, e.g., maximizing expected reward in DPO.

**Partition function** – Sums over all possible outcomes to normalize probabilities in ML, especially in RL.

**Pi (π) policy** – Defines the probability distribution over actions given a state; optimized in RL.

**Pipe outputs list** – Stores outputs of a Hugging Face pipeline, e.g., sentiment scores.

**Policy gradient** – RL method that optimizes the policy directly by maximizing expected reward.

**Proximal policy optimization (PPO)** – RL algorithm that stabilizes policy updates to prevent drastic changes.

**Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)** – RL method using human feedback to guide model training.

**Repetition penalty** – Discourages repeated token sequences in text generation for more diverse outputs.

**Reference model** – Pre-trained model used as a baseline or comparison in RL.

**Reward function** – Provides feedback on actions, guiding learning toward higher rewards.

**Reward-weighted distribution** – Adjusted probability distribution based on rewards to guide policy optimization.

**Rollout** – Generating multiple responses for a query to evaluate policy effectiveness.

**Sampling** – Selecting tokens based on probabilities in a language model rather than always choosing the most likely.

**Sentiment analysis pipeline** – Processing steps in Hugging Face to evaluate the sentiment of text.

**Sentiment score** – Reflects positive or negative sentiment of a response, used in PPO training.

**Sigmoid function** – S-shaped curve mapping values to probabilities; used in logistic regression and ML activations.

**Softmax function** – Converts model outputs into a probability distribution over classes.

**Stats_all** – Stores batch-wise training statistics during PPO sessions to track performance.

**Stochastic gradient ascent (SGA)** – Iteratively updates parameters to maximize a function, used in RL.
