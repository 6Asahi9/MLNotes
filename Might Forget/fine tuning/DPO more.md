Got it, Asahi 😎 Let’s make it **super simple and intuitive**, no scary formulas.

### **1️⃣ Desired policy vs arbitrary policy**

**Desired policy ((\pi_r))**:

* This is the policy you **actually want your model to follow**.
* It’s guided by **rewards**—so it favors outputs that humans or your reward model think are better.
* Think: **“the best behavior I want the model to do.”**

**Arbitrary policy ((\pi_{ref}))**:

* This is **any starting policy**, usually the one your model already has.
* Could be your pretrained model’s default behavior.
* Think: **“the policy I currently have, before I nudge it toward the desired behavior.”**

### **2️⃣ Partition function**

Forget formulas—think of it like this:

* **What it takes:**

  * A bunch of **scores or “weights”** for all possible outputs (like your model’s preferences or reward-adjusted probabilities).

* **What it gives:**

  * A **normalizing factor** so that if you turn those scores into probabilities, **all probabilities add up to 1**.
  * Basically: makes sure your “probabilities” are **real probabilities**.

> * Partition function = total = 10.
> * Probabilities = divide each treat by 10 → tuna 0.7, salmon 0.2, catnip 0.1.
> * Now the probabilities make sense and sum to 1 ✅

If you want, I can make a **tiny diagram with Miya and treats** showing **desired policy, arbitrary policy, and partition function**—it’s cute and super clear.

Do you want me to do that?
