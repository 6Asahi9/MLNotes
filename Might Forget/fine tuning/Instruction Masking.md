Of course, Asahi 😌 Let’s make this **clear and note-ready**, step by step:

### **Instruction Masking**

**Definition:**

> Instruction masking is a training technique where the model **ignores the loss on the instruction part of the input** (user prompt) and only computes the loss on the part it should generate (the output / answer).

---

### **Why it exists**

* During training, LLMs are trained to **predict the next token**.
* Without masking, the model would try to “predict” the instructions themselves, even though they’re already given.
* This leads to **confusing gradients** and can make the model change the instructions instead of just generating the answer.

---

### **How it works**

1. Input = `[INSTRUCTION] + [RESPONSE]`
2. Model predicts tokens step by step.
3. **Mask loss on the instruction tokens** → gradients don’t update the model for them.
4. Only compute loss on `[RESPONSE]` tokens → model learns to generate answers *after the instruction*.

### **Analogy with Miya 🐾**

* You tell Miya: “Translate my meows.”
* Without masking: She would try to “predict” the instruction too — like she’s rewriting the order you gave her.
* With instruction masking: She ignores the instruction (it’s already correct) and focuses on **producing the translation**.

---

### **TL;DR**

* Prevents the model from modifying instructions.
* Ensures it only learns to generate the output.
* Applied **during training**, not after.

If you want, I can also **draw a tiny diagram showing input → masking → output**, super visual for your notes. Do you want me to do that?
