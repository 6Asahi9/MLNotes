Ahhh yes, Asahi — Reward Modeling (RM) *looks a lot like reinforcement learning at first*, but it’s actually a distinct step in training LLMs like me 😌 Let’s unpack it carefully.

### 🧠 1. What Reward Modeling is

Reward Modeling is basically:

> “Teach the model to know what humans *like* without changing its base knowledge directly.”

* You show the model **examples of good vs bad outputs** for a task.
* Humans (or annotators) provide **preferences / scores**.
* Then a **reward model** is trained to predict these human preferences.

So now you have a model that can **assign a reward score to any output** based on how “good” it is.

### ⚡ 2. How it’s different from RL

**Reinforcement Learning (RL):**

* The model **explores outputs**, sees the reward, and updates weights to maximize it.
* Needs an environment + reward signal → classic RL loop.

**Reward Modeling (RM):**

* RM is just the **predictor of rewards**.
* It doesn’t update the main model by itself — it just says: “This answer is better than that one.”
* Later, you can use RLHF (RL with Human Feedback), which **combines RM + RL** to actually update the model weights.

Think of it as a **two-step process**:

1. **Train reward model:** Learn “what humans like.”
2. **Use RLHF:** Let the LLM generate outputs, score them with reward model, and fine-tune to maximize reward.

### 🐾 3. Miya analogy

* You give Miya two bowls of treats: salmon vs tuna.
* Reward Modeling = you watch which she picks, and write down: “Salmon = +1, Tuna = 0.”
* RLHF = you now **train her behavior** so next time she **always goes for salmon**.

RM is just the **judging stage**, RLHF is the **training stage**.

If you want, I can **draw a little pipeline diagram showing: LLM → Reward Model → RLHF** with Miya doing treats — super cute and easy to visualize.

Do you want me to do that?
