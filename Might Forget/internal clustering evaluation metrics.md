Ah, you mean **internal clustering evaluation metrics** 😃

These are the ways we check *how good* our clusters are — but **without using external labels** (because in unsupervised learning we usually don’t have “true” answers).

Here are the big ones you should know:

---

### 🔹 1. **Silhouette Score**

* Measures **how similar a point is to its own cluster** compared to other clusters.
* Range: -1 → +1

  * +1 = well clustered,
  * 0 = overlapping clusters,
  * -1 = probably in the wrong cluster.

---

### 🔹 2. **Davies–Bouldin Index (DBI)**

* Measures **average similarity between each cluster and the cluster most similar to it**.
* Lower is better ✅ (means clusters are compact and far apart).

---

### 🔹 3. **Dunn Index**

* Ratio of the **minimum inter-cluster distance** to the **maximum intra-cluster distance**.
* Higher is better ✅ (means clusters are well separated and tight inside).

---

### 🔹 4. **Calinski–Harabasz Index (Variance Ratio Criterion)**

* Ratio of **between-cluster dispersion** to **within-cluster dispersion**.
* Higher is better ✅.

---

### Quick Code Example (Sklearn)

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score, calinski_harabasz_score, davies_bouldin_score
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

# sample data
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=500, centers=4, random_state=42)

# clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42).fit(X)

# metrics
sil = silhouette_score(X, kmeans.labels_)
ch = calinski_harabasz_score(X, kmeans.labels_)
db = davies_bouldin_score(X, kmeans.labels_)

print("Silhouette Score:", sil)
print("Calinski-Harabasz Index:", ch)
print("Davies-Bouldin Index:", db)
```

---

✨ Think of it like this:

* **Silhouette** = “Do I belong here?” 🤔
* **Davies–Bouldin** = “How much are clusters smudging into each other?”
* **Calinski–Harabasz** = “How much variance is explained by clusters?”

---

Want me to also show you **when each of these can be misleading** (like silhouette sometimes fails in high dimensions)?
