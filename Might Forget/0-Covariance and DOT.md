GOOD — you have the **right irritation** with raw dot product.
Let me now **yell-clean** the confusion.

---

## 1) DOT PRODUCT — WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEASURES

[
u\cdot v = |u||v|\cos\theta
]

So YES — IT IS “sloppy” if you try to treat it as **pure direction similarity**, because:

* if vectors are long → big number
* if vectors are short → small number
* even if angle is IDENTICAL

**CONCLUSION:** dot product is a *magnitude-weighted* alignment, **not pure alignment**.

If you complain about that — GOOD — that means your brain is doing real math thinking.

---

## 2) IF YOU WANT PURE DIRECTION AGREEMENT (angle only)

Then you DO **divide out the magnitudes**:

[
\cos\theta = \frac{u\cdot v}{|u|,|v|}
]

THAT is the “direction-only” measure.
If (\cos\theta = 1) → EXACT same direction.
If (\cos\theta = -1) → EXACT opposite.
If (\cos\theta = 0) → PERPENDICULAR.

This normalized form is what people mean when they want “direction similarity only”.

---

## 3) Now covariance is NOT “just normalized dot”

You said:

> that's why we got covariance , it divides with ||d|| to get the perfect unit^2

No — covariance is a **statistical dot product**, across samples, not geometry.

Covariance is:

[
\text{cov}(X,Y)=\frac{1}{n}\sum (X_i-\bar X)(Y_i-\bar Y)
]

and correlation is the **normalized** version:

[
\text{corr}(X,Y)=\frac{\text{cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
]

This *looks like* cosine formula because **both are measuring alignment**, BUT:

| Dot / Cosine            | Correlation                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Vectors in geometry     | Variables in data          |
| No mean subtraction     | Mean removed first         |
| Measures angle directly | Measures linear dependence |
| Based on raw magnitudes | Based on variance          |

So correlation = “cosine similarity but with mean-centering and per-dimension summing”.
Not the same purpose, just mathematically analogous.

---

## QUICK SUMMARY (AGGRESSIVE VERSION)

* DOT = “HOW MUCH THEY PUSH IN SAME DIRECTION, BUT SCALE MATTERS”
* COSINE = “OK FINE LET’S IGNORE SCALE AND JUST CHECK ANGLE”
* COVARIANCE = “DOT OF DE-MEANED DATA ACROSS MANY POINTS”
* CORRELATION = “COVARIANCE BUT SCALE-INDEPENDENT LIKE COSINE”

Before I continue:
Do you want next:

`A` = continue aggressive with projections using cosine idea
`B` = connect this to Earth–asteroid shortest distance
`C` = derive projection formula from cosine interpretation

Reply with just: **A** or **B** or **C**.
