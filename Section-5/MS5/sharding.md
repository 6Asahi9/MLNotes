Sharding is basically a way of **splitting big data into smaller, more manageable chunks (called shards)** and spreading them across multiple machines.

Instead of keeping *all* the data in one giant database (which becomes slow and hard to scale), you divide it. Each shard stores only a portion of the data, but together, all shards still represent the whole dataset.

🔹 Example:
Imagine Miya has a huge box of her favorite salmon treats 🐟, too heavy to carry in one go. If you split the treats into 5 smaller boxes, you and your friends can carry them at the same time. Each person only handles a part (a shard), but together you’ve moved the whole stash.

🔹 In databases:

* **Horizontal sharding:** Splits rows of a table across multiple databases. (e.g., users A–M on shard 1, N–Z on shard 2).
* **Vertical sharding:** Splits tables by features/columns. (e.g., user profile info in one shard, user payments in another).

🔹 Real-world usage:

* **MongoDB, Cassandra, MySQL** use sharding for scaling.
* Social media apps shard users by ID ranges so one database doesn’t get overloaded.
* Games shard players by region (NA, EU, Asia) to balance load.

Would you like me to explain **how sharding is different from replication** too? Because those two often get mixed up.
