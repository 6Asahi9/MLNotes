Transfer Learning in ML is when a model trained on one task is reused (fully or partially) for a different but related task.

Difference from other learning types:

Traditional learning: Model learns from scratch for a specific task.

Transfer learning: Leverages existing knowledge to reduce training time and improve performance on a new task.

Example: Using an ImageNet-trained model to recognize medical images.

Here‚Äôs a concise summary of your text:

**Applications of Transfer Learning:**

1. **Personalized Learning (Education):** Pretrained models like GPT can be fine-tuned with student data to recommend tailored learning resources, improving outcomes and reducing development time.

2. **Sentiment Analysis (E-commerce):** Models like BERT, fine-tuned on customer reviews, can quickly identify positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, enhancing product recommendations and customer satisfaction.

3. **Demand Forecasting (Retail):** Pretrained time-series models, adapted with a retailer‚Äôs historical sales data, can predict demand accurately, optimize inventory, reduce waste, and improve customer targeting. They can also track customer sentiment and guide marketing and product strategies.

In short: **Transfer learning lets pretrained models adapt to new tasks efficiently, saving time, improving accuracy, and driving actionable insights across industries.**
