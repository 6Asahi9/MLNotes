Aah got it — you’re asking about **how they actually got the Y (labels) in speech recognition datasets** and how the model’s numeric outputs turn into words. Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Where Y comes from (training data)

Yes — in the early days of speech recognition, humans literally **transcribed** the audio into text.

* Example: Someone records: *“Hello world”*.
* A human annotator types: `Hello world`.
* That text is stored as the **ground truth label (Y)**.

Big speech datasets like **LibriSpeech, CommonVoice, TED-LIUM** are made this way. Volunteers or paid annotators listen and transcribe. So yes — it’s manual work at dataset creation time.

### 🔹 Step 2: What the model learns

* The model takes in **audio → spectrogram (X)**.
* For each chunk, it predicts a **distribution over possible characters/phonemes**.
* At first it’s random, but over time the model learns to map certain spectrogram patterns → certain letters.

For example,

* Spectrogram chunk → predicts `[h]`
* Next chunk → predicts `[e]`
* Then `[l]`, `[l]`, `[o]`

### 🔹 Step 3: How numbers → words (decoding)

The model’s raw outputs are just **probabilities over symbols** (like numbers for “a” to “z”, space, etc.).

To turn those into text, we use **decoding algorithms**:

* **Greedy decoding**: pick the most likely symbol at each step.
* **Beam search**: explore multiple likely sequences, pick the best one.
* **CTC loss (Connectionist Temporal Classification)**: special trick to align audio frames to text, since audio is longer than the word sequence.

Optionally, an **NLP language model (LM)** is added:

* Helps fix mistakes by choosing the most likely word sequence.
* Example:

  * Model predicts: `"I scream"` vs `"Ice cream"`.
  * The LM says `"Ice cream"` is more likely in English.

That’s how it gets “intelligent.”

👉 So:

1. Humans transcribed huge amounts of audio (created Y).
2. Models learned to predict sequences of letters/phonemes.
3. Decoding + NLP language models turned those predictions into fluent text.

Would you like me to **show you with a mini example** (like 1-second audio of “hi” → spectrogram → numeric prediction → decoding → `"hi"`), step by step?
