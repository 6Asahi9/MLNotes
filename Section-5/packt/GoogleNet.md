Alright, Asahi 😸, let’s talk **GoogleNet** (also called **Inception v1**) — another milestone CNN, but with a very different design than VGG16 or AlexNet.

## 🧠 What is GoogleNet?

* Developed by **Szegedy et al.** in **2014**.
* Won **ImageNet 2014** with **top-5 error of 6.7%** (better than humans at the time!).
* Its main idea: **use multiple convolution filter sizes at the same layer** and let the network **decide what features to focus on**.
* Introduced the **Inception module**.

## 🏗️ Structure Overview

Instead of stacking plain convolution layers like VGG16, GoogleNet uses **Inception modules**, which combine:

1. **1×1 convolutions** → reduce depth (computational cost)
2. **3×3 convolutions** → capture medium-scale features
3. **5×5 convolutions** → capture larger-scale features
4. **3×3 max pooling** → preserve spatial info

Then all these outputs are **concatenated along the depth dimension** → next layer sees a rich mix of features.

### ⚡ Key Features

1. **Inception Module**

   * Think of it as a “multi-lens” layer: small, medium, and large filters at the same time.
   * 1×1 convs act as **bottleneck layers** to reduce the number of channels before heavy convolutions.

2. **Very Deep but Efficient**

   * 22 layers deep (with weights), but far fewer parameters than VGG16 (~5M vs 138M).

3. **Auxiliary Classifiers**

   * Extra classifiers in middle layers during training.
   * Helps gradients flow back and avoids vanishing gradients.

### 🧩 Summary: Why it’s special

| Feature               | Why It Matters                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Inception module      | Extracts multi-scale features simultaneously |
| 1×1 convolutions      | Reduce computation while keeping depth info  |
| Deep network          | Learns complex hierarchies of features       |
| Auxiliary classifiers | Stabilize training and improve gradients     |

### 💡 Analogy with Miya

Imagine Miya is **supervising a fish tank**:

* She uses **tiny peep holes** (1×1) for details,
* **Medium glass panels** (3×3) for general fish positions,
* **Large windows** (5×5) for the whole tank,
* Then she **combines all views** to get the full picture. 😼🐟

If you want, I can **draw a simple diagram of the Inception module** so you can see exactly how GoogleNet handles different filter sizes in parallel — it makes the architecture super intuitive.

Do you want me to do that?
