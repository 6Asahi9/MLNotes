| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chunk size**                           | The maximum number of characters each text chunk can contain after being split by a text splitter.                                                                    |
| **Chroma DB**                            | An open-source vector store supported by LangChain, used for storing and retrieving vector embeddings, particularly useful in semantic search engines over text data. |
| **Cosine similarity**                    | A measure to calculate the similarity between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space, based on the cosine of the angle between them.                          |
| **Document loader**                      | A LangChain component that gathers information from sources like websites, files, and databases, and converts it into a processable format.                           |
| **Embedding**                            | A numerical representation of data in a high-dimensional space that captures its semantic meaning.                                                                    |
| **JQ schema**                            | A schema used by JSONLoader in LangChain to parse JSON files according to specific needs, extracting particular values from a JSON structure.                         |
| **LangChain**                            | A framework that simplifies developing applications with large language models (LLMs) by providing tools for loading, processing, and querying data.                  |
| **Large language model (LLM)**           | An AI model designed to understand and generate human language, often used for tasks like text generation, translation, and summarization.                            |
| **Markdown header text splitter**        | A LangChain tool that splits a markdown file by headers, maintaining document structure during text processing.                                                       |
| **Maximum marginal relevance (MMR)**     | A retrieval technique in vector stores that balances relevance and diversity of results, ensuring coverage of different query aspects.                                |
| **PyPDFLoader**                          | A LangChain class for loading PDF files into arrays of document objects, each representing a page with metadata.                                                      |
| **PyMuPDF loader**                       | A fast LangChain tool that loads PDF files into document objects with detailed metadata, producing one object per page.                                               |
| **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**       | A LangChain text splitter that recursively splits large texts into smaller chunks using character-based rules, suitable for general text processing.                  |
| **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** | A method combining retrieval-based and generative-based approaches to improve response quality, often used in QA systems.                                             |
| **Self-query retriever**                 | A LangChain retriever that converts a query into a semantic string and a metadata filter to retrieve documents based on both text and metadata.                       |
| **Separator**                            | The character(s) used by a text splitter to divide text into chunks, such as line breaks or paragraph changes.                                                        |
| **Similarity search**                    | A method in vector databases to find and retrieve the most relevant content based on similarity between vector embeddings and a query vector.                         |
| **Vector database**                      | A specialized database for storing and retrieving vector embeddings, enabling efficient information retrieval via similarity calculations.                            |
| **Vector store-based retriever**         | A LangChain retriever that queries a vector database to fetch the most similar chunks to a query, without requiring an LLM.                                           |
| **WebBaseLoader**                        | A LangChain component that extracts text from HTML webpages, converting it into a document format while ignoring unnecessary HTML tags and links.                     |

If you want, I can also **make a visually appealing version with color-coded categories** (Loaders, Splitters, Retrievers, Databases, LLM concepts) so it‚Äôs **super easy to review quickly** üòè‚ú®.

Do you want me to do that?
