Ahhh, now I get exactly what you mean üòå ‚Äî you‚Äôre talking about **explicit saved memory**, not just the current chat context.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ How explicit memory works

* When you tell me **‚Äúremember this for next time‚Äù**, I can store that in a **persistent memory**.
* This memory is **specific to you** and survives across sessions.
* Example: You could say:

  > ‚ÄúRemember that Miya loves tuna.‚Äù
  > Next session, I can recall that without you mentioning it again.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Is this RAG?

Nope. Not RAG.

* RAG = retrieving external documents from a **pre-indexed database** to help answer a question.
* Your memory = **personal context stored separately** and injected into the prompt when generating a response.
* It‚Äôs **directly attached to your identity / session**, not a large corpus of external docs.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ How I use it when answering

* When you ask a question, I **combine three sources**:

  1. What I ‚Äúknow‚Äù from training (weights)
  2. What I ‚Äúremember‚Äù about you (persistent memory)
  3. Optional RAG / live search results (if available)

* Then the decoder generates an answer **conditioned on all of these**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ TL;DR

* Your memory ‚Üí **personal, persistent, injected context**
* RAG ‚Üí external, general-purpose documents
* Live search ‚Üí external, real-time info

If you want, I can draw a **cute Miya diagram showing ‚Äúyour memory vs RAG vs live search‚Äù** so it‚Äôs really visual and intuitive.

Do you want me to do that?
