Absolutely, darling! üòΩ I‚Äôve rewritten your course glossary in **fresh** while keeping the meaning intact and easy to read:

### Course Glossary 

**Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART)**
A sequence-to-sequence large language model (LLM) with an **encoder-decoder architecture**, using encoding for understanding context and decoding to generate text.

**Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)**
An encoder-only large language model (LLM) that excels at understanding word context in sentences, useful for tasks like sentiment analysis.

**DALL-E**
AI model from OpenAI that generates creative images from text descriptions using deep learning.

**Data loader**
A component in machine learning pipelines that handles efficient batching and shuffling of data during training, optimizing memory usage.

**Data set**
A structured collection of data samples along with their labels.

**Diffusion model**
A type of generative AI model trained to create images by reconstructing or denoising examples that have been heavily altered.

**Fine-tuning**
The process of adjusting a pretrained model for better performance on a specific task or dataset.

**Generative adversarial network (GAN)**
Generative AI model consisting of a **generator** and **discriminator**, designed to produce realistic images from random input or seed images through competitive training.

**Generative AI**
Deep learning models that can create new text, images, or other content by learning patterns and structures from existing data.

**Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT)**
Transformer-based AI models pretrained on large text datasets, capable of predicting and generating text sequences.

**Hugging Face**
Open-source platform providing pretrained models and tools to simplify training and fine-tuning generative AI models.

**Iterator**
An object that can be looped over, supporting methods like `iter` and `next` to traverse elements.

**LangChain**
Open-source framework that streamlines building AI applications with large language models (LLMs).

**Large language models (LLMs)**
Foundation models using AI and deep learning with vast datasets to generate text, translate languages, and produce content. They are called ‚Äúlarge‚Äù due to dataset size and model parameters.

**Natural language processing (NLP)**
Subfield of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

**NLTK**
Python library for NLP, useful for tasks like tokenization and text manipulation.

**Pydantic**
Python library for parsing, validating, and managing data effectively.

**PyTorch**
Dynamic deep learning framework by Facebook AI Research, known for flexibility, ease of use, and dynamic computation graphs.

**Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)**
Neural networks designed for sequential or time-series data, handling dependencies over time.

**SentencePiece**
Subword tokenizer that breaks text into manageable pieces and assigns unique IDs.

**spaCy**
Open-source NLP library providing tools for tokenization, embeddings, and other text processing tasks.

**TensorFlow**
Open-source framework for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.

**Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)**
Transformer-based LLM using a text-to-text approach: encoding for understanding context and decoding for generating text.

**Tokenization**
Breaking text into smaller units (tokens) to make it easier for AI models to process and understand.

**Tokenizer**
A tool or program that splits text into tokens.

**Transformers**
Deep learning models that process sequences (text, numbers, etc.) layer by layer, commonly used for translation, summarization, and NLP tasks.

**Unigram**
Subword tokenization method that starts with a large set of possibilities and iteratively narrows down based on token frequency.

**Variational autoencoders (VAEs)**
Generative AI models using an encoder-decoder framework: the encoder compresses input into a condensed latent space, and the decoder reconstructs the original data from it.

**WaveNet**
Generative AI model designed to produce audio, such as realistic speech or music.

**WordPiece**
Subword tokenizer that merges or splits symbols to maximize efficiency while preserving meaning in NLP tasks.

If you want, darling, I can also **combine this glossary with your previous cheat sheet** into a single **cute, Miya-themed study guide** so it‚Äôs way easier and fun to memorize üòΩ‚ú®.

Do you want me to do that?
