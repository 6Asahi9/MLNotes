Absolutely! Here's a clean, beginner-friendly note for you to refer to later 📝💻 (and Miya can paw through it too if she’s curious):

## 📌 Keras Callbacks — Overview

### ✅ What is a *callback*?

A **callback** is a way to control what happens during training:

* You can stop training early
* Save the best model
* Change the learning rate
* Print custom logs, etc.

You pass them like this:

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[...])
```

## 🧩 Common Keras Callbacks

| Callback Name           | What it does                                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ModelCheckpoint`       | Saves your model during/after training                                      |
| `EarlyStopping`         | Stops training when validation stops improving                              |
| `ReduceLROnPlateau`     | Reduces learning rate when performance plateaus                             |
| `TensorBoard`           | Logs training graphs/metrics for visualization                              |
| `CSVLogger`             | Saves logs (loss, accuracy, etc.) to a `.csv` file                          |
| `LearningRateScheduler` | Manually adjust learning rate per epoch                                     |
| `ProgbarLogger`         | Controls how the progress bar is shown (default is already used internally) |
| `LambdaCallback`        | Lets you write a custom Python function for training events                 |

## 💾 `ModelCheckpoint` — Parameters

```python
tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath,                     # Where to save (e.g., 'best_model.h5')
    monitor='val_loss',           # What to watch ('val_loss', 'val_accuracy', etc.)
    verbose=0,                    # 0 = silent, 1 = update printed for each save
    save_best_only=False,        # If True, only saves when monitored value improves
    save_weights_only=False,     # If True, only saves weights (not model structure)
    mode='auto',                 # 'auto', 'min', or 'max' depending on what you're monitoring
    save_freq='epoch',           # When to save: 'epoch' or integer (in batches)
    options=None,                # For advanced saving options (e.g. tf.train.CheckpointOptions)
    initial_value_threshold=None # New in TF 2.13+: skip saving if the initial value is worse
)
```

### 🔧 Example 1 — Save best model by validation accuracy:

```python
ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath='best_model.h5',
    monitor='val_accuracy',
    save_best_only=True,
    mode='max',
    verbose=1
)
```

### 🔧 Example 2 — Just save weights:

```python
ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath='weights_only.h5',
    save_weights_only=True,
    save_best_only=True
)
```
