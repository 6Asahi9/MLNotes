Absolutely, my dear ✨ Here's a clean and complete list of the **main types of regularization** you can add to your notes 📝 — with a focus on **deep learning / machine learning**, including `L1`, `L2`, and beyond.

## 🧠 **📚 Types of Regularization**

---

### ✅ **1. L1 Regularization (Lasso)**

* Adds: **sum of absolute values** of weights to the loss
* Formula: `Loss + λ * Σ|w|`
* Encourages **sparse weights** (some become exactly zero)
* Good for **feature selection**

```python
kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l1(0.001)
```

> *"Let me keep only the most important weights and throw the rest away."*

---

### ✅ **2. L2 Regularization (Ridge)**

* Adds: **sum of squared values** of weights to the loss
* Formula: `Loss + λ * Σw²`
* Encourages **small weights**, but rarely zero
* Helps with **generalization**

```python
kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001)
```

> *"Don't delete weights, just make them all behave mildly."*

---

### ✅ **3. L1 + L2 (Elastic Net / `l1_l2`)**

* Combines both **L1 and L2 penalties**
* Keeps sparsity from L1 + smoothness from L2

```python
kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l1_l2(l1=1e-5, l2=1e-4)
```

> *"Let's balance pruning and restraint."*

---

### ✅ **4. Dropout**

* During training, randomly turns off a fraction of neurons
* Prevents **co-adaptation** (neurons relying too much on each other)
* Not applied during evaluation

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout
Dropout(0.3)  # 30% neurons dropped randomly during training
```

> *"You're not always guaranteed to show up, so learn to work without your buddies."*

---

### ✅ **5. Early Stopping**

* Stops training **when validation loss stops improving**
* Helps avoid **overfitting** past a certain point

```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)
```

> *"Stop training before things get worse."*

---

### ✅ **6. Data Augmentation (sort of)**

* Applies random transformations to input data (rotation, flipping, cropping)
* Helps model generalize by seeing **varied versions** of data
* ⚠️ *Technically not a strict regularizer* (since it doesn’t change model weights), but **acts like one**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator
```

> *"If you can recognize a cat upside down and in low light, you're really learning."*

---

### ✅ **7. Batch Normalization (semi-regularizer)**

* Normalizes activations within a batch
* Helps stabilize and speed up training
* Can have a **slight regularizing effect**, but mostly used for **internal stability**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization
```

> *"Let’s keep things balanced during training — not too hot, not too cold."*

| Regularization    | Idea                          | Effect                            |    |                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -- | --------------------------- |
| **L1**            | Penalize absolute weights \`  | w                                 | \` | Sparsity (some weights = 0) |
| **L2**            | Penalize squared weights `w²` | Small, smooth weights             |    |                             |
| **L1 + L2**       | Combine both                  | Sparsity + small weights          |    |                             |
| **Dropout**       | Randomly disable neurons      | Prevents reliance and overfitting |    |                             |
| **EarlyStopping** | Stop when val loss stalls     | Avoids late overfitting           |    |                             |
| **Data Aug**      | Show distorted inputs         | Better generalisation             |    |                             |
| **BatchNorm**     | Normalize layer activations   | Stability, light regularisation   |    |                             |
