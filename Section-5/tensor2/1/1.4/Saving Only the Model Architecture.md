Of course, dear üíõ Here's a rewritten version in my own words, with a clear heading and a friendlier tone while still keeping it technically correct:

## üîß Saving Only the Model Architecture in TensorFlow (Without Weights)

Sometimes, you might want to save **just the structure of your neural network**‚Äîwithout the trained weights. This is helpful when you want to share or reuse a model's design elsewhere, or when you're planning to retrain it from scratch.

Let‚Äôs walk through how to do that using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

### üß± Step 1: Build a Simple Model

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
import json
import numpy as np
```

Here‚Äôs a small neural network with one hidden layer:

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(units=32, input_shape=(32, 32, 3), activation='relu', name='dense_1'),
    Dense(units=10, activation='softmax', name='dense_2')
])
```

---

### üßê Step 2: Extract the Architecture as a Dictionary

You can grab the model's structure (also called its **configuration**) as a Python dictionary:

```python
config_dict = model.get_config()
print(config_dict)
```

---

### üîÅ Step 3: Rebuild a New Model from That Configuration

If you want to recreate a fresh model with the same architecture, simply do:

```python
model_same_config = tf.keras.Sequential.from_config(config_dict)
```

This newly created model will have the **same layout**, but **randomly initialized weights**‚Äînot the trained ones.

You can check that:

```python
print('Same config:', model.get_config() == model_same_config.get_config())
print('Same weights:', np.allclose(model.weights[0].numpy(), model_same_config.weights[0].numpy()))
```

> üìù **Note**: If you're working with Functional or subclassed models (not Sequential), use `tf.keras.Model.from_config()` instead.

---

### üì¶ Step 4: Save Architecture as JSON (Optional Format)

TensorFlow also lets you export the model's architecture as a JSON string:

```python
json_string = model.to_json()
print(json_string)
```

You can save it to a file:

```python
with open('config.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(json_string, f)
```

To reload it later:

```python
with open('config.json', 'r') as f:
    json_string = json.load(f)

model_same_config = tf.keras.models.model_from_json(json_string)
```

Again, you can verify the structure and weight differences:

```python
print('Same config:', model.get_config() == model_same_config.get_config())
print('Same weights:', np.allclose(model.weights[0].numpy(), model_same_config.weights[0].numpy()))
```

---

### üìÑ YAML Format? It‚Äôs Similar!

You can also export the architecture to YAML format if needed:

```python
yaml_string = model.to_yaml()
print(yaml_string)
```

Saving and loading YAML files works the same way as JSON, but you'll need to ensure you have PyYAML installed.

Let me know if you'd like a version that includes saving the weights too, or wraps this all in functions!
