Let’s give this topic a clean and clear name and rewrite the explanation in my own words!

### 📝 **Understanding TensorFlow Checkpoint Files (Weights-Only Mode)**

When you use the `ModelCheckpoint` callback in TensorFlow to save **only the model’s weights**, a few specific files are created. Each plays a unique role in storing and organizing the saved data. Let’s break down what these files are and what they do:

---

#### 📄 `checkpoint`

* **Size:** Very tiny (e.g., \~87 bytes)
* **Role:** Metadata file
* **Contents:** Text-based info that simply tells TensorFlow where the latest saved weights are.
  It includes lines like:

  ```
  model_checkpoint_path: "checkpoint"
  all_model_checkpoint_paths: "checkpoint"
  ```

  Think of this file as a **pointer** to the most recent snapshot of your model’s weights.

---

#### 📄 `checkpoint.index`

* **Size:** Small
* **Role:** Acts as a **map**
* This file tells TensorFlow **which variables are saved where**.
  In more complex setups like distributed training (across multiple machines), weights can be split into shards. The `.index` file helps stitch everything together.
  In your case, there’s just one model on one machine, so all weights are in a single shard.

---

#### 📄 `checkpoint.data-00000-of-00001`

* **Size:** Large
* **Role:** Stores the **actual model weights**
* This file holds all the numbers (parameters) your model learned during training.
  For example, if your model has 14,000 parameters, this file will store all of them—roughly 12 bytes per parameter.
