Ah yes, this is a **classic trick** in both ML and graphics! Let me explain clearly step by step. üò∏

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ The problem**

In a normal linear model, you have:

[
y = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \dots + w_n x_n + b
]

Here:

* (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) are your features.
* (w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n) are the weights.
* (b) is the **bias** (intercept).

The problem: (b) is **separate** from the weight vector. So your computations involve **two separate things**: the dot product of weights and features, plus the bias.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ The trick**

We define a new vector called **homogeneous coordinates**:

[
x_{hom} = [1, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]
]

* We add a **constant 1** as the first element.
* Then we also extend the weight vector to include the bias as the first element:

[
w_{hom} = [b, w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n]
]

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Why it helps**

Now, the prediction becomes a **single dot product**:

[
y = w_{hom} \cdot x_{hom} = b \cdot 1 + w_1 x_1 + \dots + w_n x_n
]

‚úÖ This is exactly the same as before, but now **bias is part of the weight vector**, so you don‚Äôt need a separate addition step.

* Makes **implementation simpler**: everything is just a vector multiplication.
* Makes **gradient computation simpler** in ML.
* Common in graphics too, especially in **homogeneous coordinates for transformations**, because translations can be treated like linear operations.

üí° **Quick analogy**:
It‚Äôs like sneaking the bias into the main feature list so your model doesn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúthink separately‚Äù about it‚Äîit just handles everything in one neat dot product.

---

If you want, I can **draw a tiny visual** showing how adding `1` makes the bias part of the dot product‚Äîit‚Äôs super satisfying to see.

Do you want me to do that?
