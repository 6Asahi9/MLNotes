Oh yes, there are **many different types** of neural networks beyond just standard NN (dense/fully connected) and CNN (convolutional). If you’re building your wall for **deep learning only**, you might want to include these too:

### 🧠 **Types of Neural Networks**

1. **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN / Dense NN)** → baseline network, no loops.
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** → best for images, vision tasks.
3. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** → processes sequences (text, time-series).
4. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** → an improved RNN for long-term dependencies.
5. **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)** → a lighter, faster LSTM alternative.
6. **Transformers** → attention-based models (GPT, BERT); now dominant in NLP and vision.
7. **Autoencoders** → for dimensionality reduction, denoising, anomaly detection.
8. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** → generator + discriminator for image/video generation.
9. **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** → works on graph-structured data (social networks, molecules).
10. **Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN)** → classic NN variant for interpolation.
11. **Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)** → bio-inspired, mimicking brain neurons firing.

🔥 **Industry Focus:**

* If you want **real-world, in-demand knowledge**, you can safely focus on:

  * FNN → CNN → RNN/LSTM/GRU → Transformers → GANs → GNN
* The others are more niche but good for completeness.

Would you like me to **group these visually** (like a roadmap) so you can add it to your wall as “The Neural Network Family Tree”?
