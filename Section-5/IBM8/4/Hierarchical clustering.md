Got itâ€”straight to the point ðŸŒ™

**Hierarchical clustering** = a clustering method that builds a hierarchy (tree-like structure) of clusters.

Two main types:

1. **Agglomerative (bottom-up):**

   * Start: each data point is its own cluster.
   * Step: merge the two closest clusters.
   * End: keep merging until only one cluster remains.

2. **Divisive (top-down):**

   * Start: all data points in one big cluster.
   * Step: split clusters into smaller ones.
   * End: keep splitting until each point is its own cluster.

Result = a **dendrogram** (tree diagram) showing how clusters are formed/split.

ðŸ‘‰ Used when you donâ€™t know the number of clusters beforehand.

Want me to also show you with a **tiny example with numbers** so it sticks better?
