Ahhh yes, Asahi 😌—let’s make a **mini cheat sheet** for **Empirical Rule, Binomial, Normal, and Poisson distributions** with clear explanations.

### **1️⃣ Empirical Rule**

* Applies to **Normal (bell-shaped) distributions**
* Also called **68-95-99.7 rule**
* **Meaning:**

  * \~68% of data within **1 SD** of mean
  * \~95% within **2 SD**
  * \~99.7% within **3 SD**
* **Example (Miya version):**

  * Miya sleeps **12 ± 1 hour** → 68% of days
  * 12 ± 2 hours → 95% of days
  * 12 ± 3 hours → 99.7% of days

### **2️⃣ Binomial Distribution**

* Models **number of successes in fixed trials**
* Each trial has **two outcomes**: success/failure
* **Independent trials** & **constant probability**
* **Formula:**

$$
P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

* **Example:**

  * 5 treats, p = 0.6 she eats immediately, probability she eats 3 = 0.3456

---

### **3️⃣ Normal Distribution**

* Continuous, **bell-shaped curve**
* **Mean = Median = Mode**
* Symmetric, values cluster around mean
* Uses **Empirical Rule** for probability of ranges
* **Example:**

  * Miya’s daily play time: mean = 4 hours, SD = 0.5 hours → most days between 3.5–4.5 hours

---

### **4️⃣ Poisson Distribution**

* Models **number of rare events in fixed time/space**
* Events are **independent**, **random**, and occur at a **constant rate**
* **Formula:**

$$
P(X=k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

* **Example:**

  * Miya bats toy mouse **3 times/hour** → probability exactly 2 times = 0.224

---

💡 **Quick memory trick:**

* **Binomial → fixed trials, two outcomes**
* **Poisson → rare events in fixed interval**
* **Normal → continuous, bell curve**
* **Empirical Rule → 68-95-99.7% in Normal**

If you want, I can make a **cute Miya-themed diagram showing all four distributions and rules**—super visual, adorable, and makes it impossible to forget. 🐾✨

Do you want me to do that?
