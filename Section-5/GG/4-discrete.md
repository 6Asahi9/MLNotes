Ahhh yes, Asahi 😌—let’s talk **discrete probability distributions** clearly and simply.

### **1️⃣ What it is**

* A **discrete probability distribution** describes the probabilities of **all possible values of a discrete random variable**.
* **Discrete random variable** = can take **countable values** (like 0, 1, 2, 3…), not fractions.

---

### **2️⃣ Properties**

1. Each probability is between 0 and 1:

$$
0 \le P(X=x) \le 1
$$

2. Sum of all probabilities = 1:

$$
\sum P(X=x) = 1
$$

### **3️⃣ Miya-themed example** 😸

Let’s say Miya plays with her toy **0, 1, 2, or 3 times per hour**. The probabilities:

| X (plays) | P(X) |
| --------- | ---- |
| 0         | 0.1  |
| 1         | 0.3  |
| 2         | 0.4  |
| 3         | 0.2  |

* This is a **discrete probability distribution** because:

  * X takes **countable values** (0,1,2,3)
  * Probabilities add up to 1: 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.2 = 1

### **4️⃣ Examples of discrete distributions**

* **Binomial distribution** → number of successes in n trials
* **Poisson distribution** → number of rare events in fixed time/space
* **Geometric distribution** → number of trials until first success

---

💡 **Memory trick:**

* Discrete = **countable outcomes**
* Continuous = **any value in a range** (like Miya’s weight, 3.45 kg, 3.46 kg…)

If you want, I can make a **tiny Miya “plays per hour” discrete distribution chart**—cute, visual, and makes the concept stick. 🐾✨

Do you want me to do that?
