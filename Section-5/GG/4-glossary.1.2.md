Bayes’ rule: (Refer to Bayes’ theorem)									

Bayesian inference: (Refer to Bayesian statistics)									

Bayesian statistics: A powerful method for analyzing and interpreting data in modern data analytics; Also referred to as Bayesian inference									

Binomial distribution: A discrete distribution that models the probability of events with only two possible outcomes: success or failure									

Classical probability: A type of probability based on formal reasoning about events with equally likely outcomes							

Complement of an event: In statistics, refers to an event not occurring									

Complement rule: A concept stating that the probability that event A does not occur is one minus the probability of A							

Conditional probability: Refers to the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred									

Continuous random variable: A variable that takes all the possible values in some range of numbers									

Dependent events: The concept that two events are dependent if one event changes the probability of the other event									

Discrete random variable: A variable that has a countable number of possible values									

Empirical probability: A type of probability based on experimental or historical data									

Empirical rule: A concept stating that the values on a normal curve are distributed in a regular pattern, based on their distance from the mean	

False positive: A test result that indicates something is present when it really is not									

Independent events: The concept that two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not change the probability of the other event									

Multiplication rule (for independent events): The concept that if the events A and B are independent, then the probability of both A and B happening is the probability of A multiplied by the probability of B																

Mutually exclusive: The concept that two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time								

Normal distribution: A continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical on both sides of the mean and bell-shaped								

Objective probability: A type of probability based on statistics, experiments, and mathematical measurements								

Poisson distribution: A probability distribution that models the probability that a certain number of events will occur during a specific time period								

Posterior probability: Refers to the updated probability of an event based on new data									

Prior probability: Refers to the probability of an event before new data is collected									

Probability: The branch of mathematics that deals with measuring and quantifying uncertainty									

Probability distribution: A function that describes the likelihood of the possible outcomes of a random event											

Random experiment: A process whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty									

Random variable: A variable that represents the values for the possible outcomes of a random event									

Sample space: The set of all possible values for a random variable									

Standard deviation: A statistic that calculates the typical distance of a data point from the mean of a dataset							

Standardization: The process of putting different variables on the same scale									

Subjective probability: A type of probability based on personal feelings, experience, or judgment																

Z-score: A measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a data point is
