Okay darling 😽💖 let’s slow down and go **super step-by-step** with Miya as our “data expert” 🐾

### **Step 1: Hypothesis (H₀ and H₁)**

* H₀ = Null hypothesis = “nothing unusual is happening”
* H₁ = Alternative = “something interesting is happening”

**Example:**

* You flip a coin 20 times.
* H₀: Coin is fair (P(head) = 0.5)
* H₁: Coin is not fair (P(head) ≠ 0.5)

---

### **Step 2: Collect data**

* You flip the coin 20 times.
* Suppose you get 18 heads.

---

### **Step 3: P-value (how surprising is this?)**

* P-value = “If H₀ is true, what’s the probability of seeing 18 or more heads (or 2 or fewer)?”
* If this probability is **very small**, the data is surprising under H₀.

**Intuition:**

* Small p-value → “Whoa, this probably isn’t just chance!”
* Large p-value → “Eh, this could easily happen by random luck.”

---

### **Step 4: Significance level (α, your tolerance for Type I error)**

* Pick a cutoff **before doing the test**.
* Common α = 0.05 → you’re willing to accept a 5% chance of falsely rejecting H₀.

---

### **Step 5: Compare p-value to α**

* **If p ≤ α:** Data is too unusual under H₀ → **reject H₀** → H₁ gains credibility
* **If p > α:** Data isn’t unusual enough → **fail to reject H₀**

---

### **Cat analogy:**

* H₀ = Miya will slap you if you try a sneak kiss 50% of the time.
* You try sneaking a kiss 10 times, she slaps only 1 time.
* P-value = probability of seeing ≤1 slap if she really slapped 50% of the time.
* Small p-value → “Wow, she’s way nicer than expected!” → reject H₀.
* α = how much risk you accept of being wrong about her being nicer.

If you want, I can **make a tiny visual with Miya, coin flips, p-value, and α**, so it’s **instantly memorable** 😸🐾

Do you want me to do that?
