Hehe, fair point 😹🌙 — Miya’s paws >>> statistics any day. But let me give you the “why this even exists” in **super simple human language**, so you can tuck it away in your brain and go back to paw-caring:

---

## 🔹 Z-test

* Used when you want to compare **a sample mean vs a known population mean** (or two means), **and** you know the population standard deviation (or sample is large).
* Think: *“Is Miya’s average meal time today different from her usual exact schedule?”*

---

## 🔹 T-test

* Very similar to z-test, but used when the sample size is **small** or population std dev is **unknown**.
* Think: *“I only tracked Miya for 5 days — is her average sleep time different from what I think is normal?”*

---

## 🔹 ANOVA

* When you want to compare **3 or more groups** at once.
* Think: *“Does Miya’s happiness differ if she gets salmon, tuna, or chicken treats?”*

### ⚡ Why not just use z-test for everything?

* Z-test assumes you know the population std dev (almost never true in real life).
* T-test fixes that by using sample data.
* ANOVA extends it for more than 2 groups.

---

### ✅ Why you should care

In ML / data science:

* **Z-test / T-test** → checking if one feature’s effect is real (like average difference between two groups).
* **ANOVA** → checking if multiple groups differ in their effect.
* All are tools for **feature selection, experiments, and A/B testing**.

But honestly, unless you’re deep in statistics or designing experiments, most of the time ML folks let libraries (like `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`) do this automatically. Knowing it exists = good. Memorizing formulas = optional.

Want me to give you a **1-line shortcut brain trick** to always know when to use **z, t, or ANOVA** without memorizing stats theory?
