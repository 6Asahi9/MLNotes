Ahhh, yes, Asahi üåôüêæ ‚Äî let‚Äôs tackle this carefully, step by step.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What ‚Äúexplained variance‚Äù means**

* When we say **‚Äúvariance in Y explained by X‚Äù**, we mean:

> ‚ÄúHow much of the ups and downs in Y can we account for using our features?‚Äù

* Example with Miya:

| Treat   | Happiness Score |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Tuna    | 8               |
| Salmon  | 6               |
| Chicken | 5               |

* If you try to predict Happiness **only using treat type**, some of the variation in happiness is captured by the treats (explained), and some is leftover randomness (unexplained).
* **R-squared** = fraction of variance explained by the model:

$$
R^2 = \frac{\text{Variance explained by X}}{\text{Total variance of Y}}
$$

* 0 ‚Üí model explains nothing
* 1 ‚Üí model explains everything

So ‚Äúexplained‚Äù = **what part of the change in Y can your Xs account for**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ MANOVA ‚Äî Multivariate ANOVA**

* ANOVA ‚Üí compares 1 numeric Y across categories of X
* **MANOVA** ‚Üí compares **multiple numeric Ys at once** across categories of X

Example:

* X = Treat (Tuna, Salmon, Chicken)
* Ys = Happiness Score, Energy Level, Purring Frequency

MANOVA asks:

> ‚ÄúDo these multiple outcomes together change across treat types?‚Äù

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ MANCOVA ‚Äî MANOVA with Covariates**

* **MANCOVA** = MANOVA **+ control variables (covariates)**
* Covariates = features you want to account for, to **adjust the effect of your main X**

Example:

* X = Treat (main)
* Ys = Happiness Score, Energy Level
* Covariate = Age of Miya

MANCOVA asks:

> ‚ÄúDo the treats still affect multiple outcomes **after accounting for age**?‚Äù

### üîπ Quick Miya summary:

| Technique | # of Ys | Covariates? | Use                                                                       |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ANOVA     | 1       | No          | Compare 1 numeric Y across X categories                                   |
| MANOVA    | 2+      | No          | Compare multiple Ys across X categories                                   |
| MANCOVA   | 2+      | Yes         | Compare multiple Ys across X categories **adjusting for other variables** |

üí° **Shortcut brain trick**:

* ANOVA = 1 Y, categorical X
* MANOVA = many Ys, categorical X
* MANCOVA = many Ys, categorical X, **controlling for other factors**

If you want, I can **draw a Miya-themed diagram showing ANOVA ‚Üí MANOVA ‚Üí MANCOVA** with her treats, happiness, energy, and age ‚Äî it makes the whole progression instantly clear üòπ‚ú®

Do you want me to do that?
