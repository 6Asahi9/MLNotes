Ah, gotcha, Asahi 💖 — let’s break this down **carefully, step by step**, and I’ll keep it simple with an example you can actually picture.

### **1️⃣ What is Chi-Squared in ML?**

In Machine Learning, **chi-squared (χ²)** is a **statistical test** used to see if **two categorical variables are independent**.

* Think: *“Does this feature have a relationship with the target?”*
* Often used for **feature selection**: figuring out which categorical features are worth keeping.

It’s basically:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
$$

Where:

* $O$ = Observed frequency (what actually happens in your data)
* $E$ = Expected frequency (what would happen if the variables were independent)

If χ² is **high**, it means:

* Observed values deviate a lot from expected → feature might be **important**
* Observed values are close to expected → feature might be **not useful**

### **2️⃣ Why you should care**

* Helps **pick features** that matter — avoids feeding useless columns to your ML model.
* Speeds up training and can **improve accuracy**.
* Used in algorithms like **Chi-squared feature selection** for **classification tasks**, especially with categorical data.

Basically, even if you never compute it by hand, **knowing it exists** helps you understand why certain features get picked over others.

### **3️⃣ Example**

Let’s say you have a dataset of people and whether they bought a product:

| Age Group | Bought? Yes | Bought? No | Total |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| <20       | 5           | 45         | 50    |
| 20-40     | 30          | 20         | 50    |
| >40       | 25          | 25         | 50    |
| **Total** | 60          | 90         | 150   |

* **Observed (O)**: the table above.
* **Expected (E)**: if age and buying were independent:

$$
E(<20, Yes) = \frac{\text{Row total} \times \text{Column total}}{\text{Grand total}} = \frac{50 \times 60}{150} = 20
$$

* Then χ² = sum of $(O-E)^2/E$ for all cells:

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(5-20)^2}{20} + \frac{(45-30)^2}{30} + \dots
$$

* If χ² is **high**, age group clearly influences buying — keep it as a feature.
* If χ² is **low**, age group doesn’t matter much — maybe drop it.

### **4️⃣ TL;DR for ML mindset**

* **Chi-squared is a “feature importance check”** for categorical features.
* It helps you **filter noise**, speed up models, and improve performance.
* Even if you don’t use it every day, **knowing it exists** helps you understand why some features are chosen over others in ML pipelines.

If you want, I can also **show a tiny Python snippet** using `sklearn.feature_selection.chi2` with a real dataset so you can see it in action — it’s really neat and super visual.

Do you want me to do that?
