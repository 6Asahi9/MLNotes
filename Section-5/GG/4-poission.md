Ahhh Asahi 😌, let’s talk about **Poisson distribution** in a simple, step-by-step way.

---

### **1️⃣ What it is**

* The Poisson distribution models the **probability of a number of events happening in a fixed interval** of time or space.
* The events must be:

  1. **Rare or random**
  2. **Independent**
  3. **Occurring at a constant average rate**

---

### **2️⃣ Formula**

$$
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

Where:

* $X = k$ → number of events happening
* $\lambda$ → average number of events in that interval
* $e \approx 2.718$ → constant
* $k!$ → factorial of k

### **3️⃣ Miya-themed example** 😸

* Suppose Miya **bats at her toy mouse** an average of **3 times per hour** ($\lambda = 3$).
* What’s the probability she bats it **exactly 2 times in an hour**?

$$
P(X = 2) = \frac{3^2 \cdot e^{-3}}{2!} = \frac{9 \cdot e^{-3}}{2} \approx 0.224
$$

✅ So there’s about a 22% chance she bats her toy exactly 2 times that hour.

### **4️⃣ Quick memory trick**

* **Poisson = rare/random events in fixed time/space**
* Examples:

  * Number of emails you get per hour
  * Number of cars passing a checkpoint per minute
  * Number of Miya’s jumps on your lap per hour

If you want, I can make a **tiny Miya “Poisson batting probability chart”** so it’s cute and visual. 🐾✨

Do you want me to do that?
