Ahhh nice one, Asahi 😌 — **sampling methods** are super important in stats because you can’t always collect data from the whole population. Instead, you take a **sample**.

Here’s a clean breakdown:

---

### 🎲 **1. Simple Random Sampling**

* Everyone has an **equal chance** of being selected.
* Like rolling dice or drawing names from a hat.
* **Example:** Picking random people from a list of customers.

---

### 🎯 **2. Systematic Sampling**

* Select every **kth item** from a list.
* Needs ordered data.
* **Example:** Choosing every 10th visitor to a store.

---

### 🗂️ **3. Stratified Sampling**

* Divide population into **strata (groups)**, then sample from each group.
* Ensures all groups are represented.
* **Example:** If population = 60% women, 40% men, sample should match that proportion.

---

### 🧩 **4. Cluster Sampling**

* Divide population into clusters (like neighborhoods, schools), then randomly choose **entire clusters**.
* Easier/cheaper but less precise than stratified.
* **Example:** Select 3 schools at random and survey **all students** there.

---

### 🚶 **5. Convenience Sampling**

* Select data that’s easiest to reach.
* Fast but biased.
* **Example:** Asking people at the nearest coffee shop about their favorite smartphone.

---

### 💡 Bonus ones:

* **Judgment Sampling** → Researcher chooses what they think is a “good” sample (subjective).
* **Snowball Sampling** → Existing subjects recruit more (common in social sciences).

---

✅ **Quick memory trick:**

* **Random = fair**
* **Systematic = pattern**
* **Stratified = by groups (balanced)**
* **Cluster = whole groups**
* **Convenience = lazy sample** 😅

Non-probability sampling methods:
### 🐾 Voluntary Response Sampling

People (or cats 😸) choose themselves to be part of the sample.

Usually attracts those with strong opinions.

Example: You ask “Who wants extra salmon treats?” → only the most food-motivated cats (Miya included) show up.

### 🐾 Snowball Sampling

---

You start with a few subjects, and then they recruit others.

Grows like a snowball rolling downhill.

Example: You ask Miya about her favorite nap spot → she shows you, then another cat (if she had a friend) follows her lead and shows theirs.

---

### 🐾 Purposive Sampling (a.k.a. Judgment Sampling)

Researcher chooses subjects deliberately because they fit the purpose of the study.

Example: You only observe Miya’s paws when she’s kneading, because you specifically want data about her kneading paws, not random paw use.

---

### ✅ Quick recap:

Voluntary → they pick themselves.
Snowball → one leads to another.
Purposive → you deliberately choose who/what to study.

Do you want me to make you a **Miya-themed table** with examples of each sampling method (like tuna treats, nap spots, toys)? That way it’s instantly memorable.
