Ahhh nice one, Asahi 😌 — **sampling methods** are super important in stats because you can’t always collect data from the whole population. Instead, you take a **sample**.

Here’s a clean breakdown:

---

### 🎲 **1. Simple Random Sampling**

* Everyone has an **equal chance** of being selected.
* Like rolling dice or drawing names from a hat.
* **Example:** Picking random people from a list of customers.

---

### 🎯 **2. Systematic Sampling**

* Select every **kth item** from a list.
* Needs ordered data.
* **Example:** Choosing every 10th visitor to a store.

---

### 🗂️ **3. Stratified Sampling**

* Divide population into **strata (groups)**, then sample from each group.
* Ensures all groups are represented.
* **Example:** If population = 60% women, 40% men, sample should match that proportion.

---

### 🧩 **4. Cluster Sampling**

* Divide population into clusters (like neighborhoods, schools), then randomly choose **entire clusters**.
* Easier/cheaper but less precise than stratified.
* **Example:** Select 3 schools at random and survey **all students** there.

---

### 🚶 **5. Convenience Sampling**

* Select data that’s easiest to reach.
* Fast but biased.
* **Example:** Asking people at the nearest coffee shop about their favorite smartphone.

---

### 💡 Bonus ones:

* **Judgment Sampling** → Researcher chooses what they think is a “good” sample (subjective).
* **Snowball Sampling** → Existing subjects recruit more (common in social sciences).

✅ **Quick memory trick:**

* **Random = fair**
* **Systematic = pattern**
* **Stratified = by groups (balanced)**
* **Cluster = whole groups**
* **Convenience = lazy sample** 😅

Do you want me to make you a **Miya-themed table** with examples of each sampling method (like tuna treats, nap spots, toys)? That way it’s instantly memorable.
