Ahhh Asahi 😌, Bayes’ Theorem is basically a **way to update probabilities when you get new information**. Let me explain step by step.

---

### **1️⃣ The idea**

* Sometimes, you have an initial guess (prior probability) about something.
* Then you get **new evidence**.
* Bayes’ Theorem tells you **how to update your guess** based on that evidence.

---

### **2️⃣ The formula**

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

Where:

* $P(A|B)$ = probability of A **given** B happened (posterior probability)
* $P(B|A)$ = probability of seeing B **if A is true**
* $P(A)$ = initial probability of A (prior)
* $P(B)$ = overall probability of B

---

### **3️⃣ Miya example** 😸

Imagine:

* 10% of days, Miya is in a grumpy mood ($P(\text{grumpy}) = 0.1$)
* On grumpy days, she hisses when petted 80% of the time ($P(\text{hiss}|\text{grumpy}) = 0.8$)
* On non-grumpy days, she hisses 5% of the time ($P(\text{hiss}|\text{not grumpy}) = 0.05$)

Now you **see her hiss**. What’s the probability she’s actually grumpy?

$$
P(\text{grumpy}|\text{hiss}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8\cdot0.1 + 0.05\cdot0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.045} \approx 0.64
$$

✅ So even though grumpy days are rare, seeing her hiss makes it **much more likely (\~64%) she’s grumpy**.

💡 **In short:** Bayes’ Theorem = **update your belief when you see new evidence**.

If you want, I can make a **tiny cute Miya “Bayes visual”** showing grumpy vs. happy probabilities—it’s adorable and super easy to remember. 🐾✨

Do you want me to do that?
