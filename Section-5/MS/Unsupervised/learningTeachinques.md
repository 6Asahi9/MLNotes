1. Clustering
### Key clustering algorithms
The k-means method partitions the data into a predefined number of clusters. It minimizes the distance between data points and the cluster center (centroid). It works best with spherical, evenly distributed clusters.

The DBSCAN algorithm clusters data based on density. It groups points that are close together, identifying outliers or noise that do not belong to any cluster. It is useful for datasets with clusters of varying shapes and densities.

The Hierarchical clustering method builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging smaller clusters into larger ones (agglomerative) or splitting larger clusters into smaller ones (divisive). It’s useful for visualizing the structure of data.

### Comparison of clustering algorithms
k-means works well with evenly distributed clusters but struggles with nonspherical clusters or noise.

DBSCAN handles irregularly shaped clusters and noise but can be sensitive to the choice of parameters such as eps (maximum distance between points) and min_samples (minimum points in a cluster).

Hierarchical clustering offers a flexible approach that allows you to decide on the number of clusters after examining the dendrogram, but it is computationally expensive for large datasets.

2. Dimensionality reduction
### Key dimensionality reduction techniques
PCA is a linear transformation method that reduces the number of features by projecting the data onto a set of orthogonal components (principal components) that capture the maximum variance.

t-SNE is a nonlinear technique used primarily for data visualization. It reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving local structure, making it effective for uncovering clusters or patterns.

Autoencoders are neural network-based techniques that compress data into a lower-dimensional space and then reconstruct it. Autoencoders are effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and can capture complex patterns in the data.

### Comparison of dimensionality reduction techniques
PCA is best suited for linear relationships and global variance preservation. It’s also computationally efficient for large datasets.

t-SNE is ideal for nonlinear data and great for visualizing local structures and clusters. However, it’s computationally expensive for large datasets and not ideal for predictive modeling.

Autoencoders are suitable for nonlinear data and tasks requiring reconstruction, but they require more computational resources and training time.

3. Anomaly detection
### Key anomaly detection algorithms
Isolation forest is an unsupervised learning algorithm that isolates anomalies by randomly partitioning the data. Anomalies are more likely to be isolated quickly, while normal points require more partitions.

The One-class SVM is a variant of SVMs designed for anomaly detection. It learns a boundary that separates normal data from anomalies.

Autoencoders, when used for anomaly detection, reconstruct the data, and large reconstruction errors indicate anomalies.

### Comparison of anomaly detection algorithms
Isolation forest is fast and effective for large datasets but may not perform well in high-dimensional spaces.

One-class SVM is good for datasets with clear boundaries between normal and anomalous data but can be slow for large datasets.

Autoencoders are capable of detecting complex anomalies but require extensive training time and computational resources.
