🔢 1. Decision Trees
Split data with yes/no questions

Build a tree to make decisions

📌 Classification & regression

🧮 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Reduces number of features

Keeps most important info

📌 Dimensionality reduction

📏 3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Finds best dividing line (or hyperplane)

Maximizes margin between classes

📌 Classification

🐣 4. Naive Bayes
Uses Bayes’ Theorem

Assumes features are independent

📌 Text classification, spam detection

🎯 5. K-Means Clustering
Groups data into K clusters

Repeats: assign → update centers

📌 Unsupervised clustering

🧱 6. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
Finds clusters based on density

Labels outliers as noise

📌 Irregular shapes, noisy data

🛒 7. Apriori Algorithm
Finds frequent item combinations

Builds association rules

📌 Market basket analysis

🌈 8. t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
Reduces dimensions to 2D/3D

Preserves local structure

📌 Data visualization

🌲 9. Isolation Forest
Anomaly detection by isolating points

Outliers are easier to isolate

📌 Fraud detection, rare events

🌳 10. Hierarchical Clustering
Builds a cluster tree (dendrogram)

Zoom in/out to choose cluster detail

📌 When you don’t know K or want nested groups
