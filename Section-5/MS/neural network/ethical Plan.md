### üîß AI/ML Development Planning Activity

**Overview**
In this task, you'll build a complete project plan for designing an AI/ML system from the ground up. You'll apply your understanding of key steps‚Äîsuch as data preparation, model creation, evaluation, deployment, and maintenance‚Äîto outline a practical workflow for a real-world machine learning application.

By completing this task, you‚Äôll be able to:

* Build a full end-to-end plan for designing and deploying an ML system.
* Apply core concepts like data preprocessing, model choice, evaluation metrics, and production strategies in a realistic context.

### üõ†Ô∏è Project Scenario

**Business context**
A retail brand wants to identify customers who are at risk of cancelling their subscriptions. They‚Äôve provided data including customer purchase history, interactions with support teams, and subscription details. Your goal is to build an ML model that predicts customer churn so the company can take preventative actions to retain them.

---

### üß© Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### **Step 1: Clarify the Problem**

Define your project's main objective.
Ask yourself:

* What are we trying to predict? ‚Üí Customer churn.
* Why does this matter? ‚Üí Early detection of churners can reduce revenue loss.
* What should the system output? ‚Üí A ranked list of customers with their churn probability.

---

#### **Step 2: Data Planning**

Identify and describe the data you'll need:

* **Types of data**: Numerical (e.g., total purchases), categorical (e.g., subscription type), and possibly text (e.g., support ticket logs).
* **Sources**: CRM databases, e-commerce logs, support system exports.
* **Preparation steps**:

  * Handle missing values.
  * Encode categorical fields.
  * Normalize numerical inputs.
  * Extract new features like "customer lifetime" or "support interactions per month".

---

#### **Step 3: Choosing an ML Approach**

Select your model(s) based on the problem type‚Äîthis is a **classification task**.

* Possible models: Logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, or XGBoost.
* Consider how you‚Äôll split the data: training, validation, and test sets, possibly using **k-fold cross-validation**.
* Add value by engineering custom features that may reveal behavioral patterns.

---

#### **Step 4: Evaluating the Model**

Decide how you‚Äôll assess the model‚Äôs effectiveness:

* **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
* **Overfitting controls**: Cross-validation, regularization, early stopping, etc.
* Plan to compare multiple models using these metrics and pick the best-performing one.

---

#### **Step 5: Deployment Strategy**

How will you turn your model into a usable tool?

* **Platform**: Could be deployed on AWS, Azure, or GCP.
* **Integration**: The model can interact with the company‚Äôs CRM system via an API or feed predictions into a dashboard for the customer support team.

---

#### **Step 6: Ongoing Monitoring**

After launching, your system will need to be maintained.

* **Monitoring tools**: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or custom dashboards to track accuracy over time.
* **Retraining policy**: Set a schedule or performance threshold that triggers retraining with fresh data.

### üìÑ Final Deliverables

Your final plan (about 400‚Äì500 words) should include:

1. **Problem Definition**: What you‚Äôre solving and why it matters.
2. **Data Requirements**: The data you‚Äôll use and how you‚Äôll clean and prepare it.
3. **Modeling Approach**: The ML models you‚Äôll try and how you‚Äôll evaluate them.
4. **Deployment Strategy**: How you‚Äôll bring the model into the company‚Äôs workflow.
5. **Maintenance Plan**: How you‚Äôll monitor the model and keep it accurate over time.

### ‚úÖ Wrapping Up

By working through this planning exercise, you‚Äôve mapped out how to approach a business problem with AI/ML tools‚Äîfrom data handling to deployment. This kind of structured thinking is crucial when turning machine learning concepts into impactful real-world systems. Keep building, experimenting, and refining your approach‚ÄîAI/ML is a constantly growing field full of exciting challenges.
