## üß† Project Brief: Predictive Maintenance for Autonomous Drones

### *(Redesigned in original words for open use)*

### üìå Overview

In this project, you'll explore a practical scenario involving real-world AI/ML application. Your task is to develop a strategy for deploying an AI-powered predictive maintenance system for a fleet of delivery drones. You'll think through challenges in deployment, suggest repair methods, and outline how to manage and scale the system effectively.

By completing this, you‚Äôll strengthen your understanding of:

* Identifying problems in AI/ML implementations
* Choosing the right models and preprocessing techniques
* Building a reliable deployment workflow
* Creating a long-term maintenance strategy

### üõ∞Ô∏è Case Study: Drone Failures and Predictive Maintenance

**Scenario:**
A logistics company operates a network of autonomous drones to deliver packages in urban areas. Lately, they've faced a rise in unplanned breakdowns, causing shipment delays and higher operational costs. Although the drones are equipped with many sensors (battery, temperature, GPS, motor data, etc.), the company relies on a fixed-time maintenance schedule, which doesn‚Äôt account for real-time wear and tear. To improve reliability, they want to implement an AI/ML solution that can *predict* failures before they happen.

---

### üß© Step 1: Understanding the Problem

**Main issues:**

* Drones fail unexpectedly, disrupting deliveries
* The current maintenance model is time-based, not condition-based

**Data available:**

* Live sensor readings (battery life, motor speed, internal temps, GPS, flight time, etc.)
* Historical failure events and service logs

**System requirements:**

* Real-time monitoring and alerting
* Accurate failure prediction to allow proactive servicing
* Integration with the current fleet management software

---

### ü§ñ Step 2: AI/ML Solution Planning

**Approach:**

* Use **time-series forecasting** or **anomaly detection** for monitoring sensor behavior over time
* Apply **regression models** to estimate remaining useful life (RUL) of components
* Use **classification models** to assess failure risk based on real-time data

**Data prep:**

* Normalize sensor values and clean missing data
* Engineer features such as rate of battery drop, motor heat fluctuation, flight stress levels, etc.

**Model training:**

* Train using past failure logs to capture failure patterns
* Evaluate models using appropriate metrics:

  * *For classification:* precision, recall, accuracy
  * *For regression:* RMSE, R¬≤ score

---

### üöÄ Step 3: Deployment Strategy

**Deployment options:**

* Use cloud-based deployment to handle large-scale data from many drones
* Or deploy to edge devices for faster, on-board decision-making with minimal latency

**Integration:**

* Connect the model to the drone control dashboard
* Trigger alerts when a potential fault is detected
* Visual dashboards for maintenance teams to track drone health in real time

**Monitoring:**

* Continuously track model performance
* Set up automatic retraining when model performance drops or enough new data is collected

---

### üîß Step 4: Maintenance Plan

**Error correction:**

* If the system gives too many false alerts (or misses real faults), adjust thresholds or retrain with better-labeled data

**Model drift:**

* As drones age or new models are introduced, retrain regularly to adapt to changes in drone behavior and performance

**Scalability:**

* As the fleet grows, ensure the system can handle larger datasets and provide real-time predictions for all units

### üìÑ Final Deliverables

1. **Solution report (300‚Äì400 words):**
   Include:

* Key challenges
* Chosen AI/ML methods
* Preprocessing and feature engineering
* Deployment setup
* Maintenance and scaling strategy

2. **(Optional) Code prototype:**

* Load and preprocess drone sensor data
* Train a predictive model (e.g., time series, regression)
* Visualize drone health and predicted failure events

### üéØ Summary

This exercise simulates a real-life use of AI in the field. You'll explore how to deploy and manage a predictive maintenance system, ensuring the drones remain reliable and efficient. You'll also gain insights into the system engineering side of AI, including long-term support, integration, and performance monitoring.
