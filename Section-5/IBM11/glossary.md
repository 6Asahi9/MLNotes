# Course Glossary: AI Models for NLP

This glossary organizes important terms in alphabetical order. It includes not only concepts from the course but also widely used industry terms. These are key for understanding natural language processing (NLP), working in AI, or joining professional groups and certifications.

### Bag-of-Words

A simple way to represent text by treating a document as a ‚Äúbag‚Äù of its words. It ignores grammar and order, focusing only on which words appear and how often.

### Bi-gram Model

A probability-based language model that considers one word of context (the word just before the target) to predict the next word.

### Context Vector

A representation formed by combining the embeddings of surrounding context words. It reflects both vocabulary size and chosen context size.

### Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)

A word embedding method where the surrounding words are used to guess the missing or target word.

### Cross-Entropy Loss

A metric for classification models. It measures how far off predicted probabilities are from the true labels. Lower values mean better performance.

### Data Loader

A tool that batches and shuffles data efficiently while training neural networks. It also manages preprocessing to save memory, especially with large datasets.

### Dataset

A structured collection of samples (inputs) along with their labels (outputs or categories).

### Embedding Layer

A neural network layer that maps discrete token IDs (words, subwords) into continuous dense vectors.

### Fine-Tuning

Adapting a pretrained model to a specific dataset or task to improve its accuracy and contextual relevance.

### Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that uses gates to manage information flow. It is simpler and faster to train than LSTMs but achieves similar results.

### Hyperparameters

External settings that control how a model trains (e.g., batch size, number of layers, learning rate). They are not learned during training.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

Massive AI models trained on huge datasets with billions of parameters. They can generate text, answer questions, and perform many language-related tasks.

### Learnable Parameters

The weights and biases inside a model that get adjusted during training.

### Learning Rate

A hyperparameter that determines the step size in updating parameters. Too high may cause instability, too low may cause slow training.

### Logits

The raw output of a neural network before applying an activation function like softmax or sigmoid.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

An advanced RNN architecture designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, especially useful for NLP.

### Loss Function

A mathematical expression that quantifies the difference between model predictions and the true outputs. Training minimizes this loss.

### Monte Carlo Sampling

A statistical technique that estimates values by generating random samples, especially useful for probabilistic models.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The AI subfield focused on enabling machines to understand, process, and generate human language.

### Neural Networks

Computational models inspired by the brain, made up of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that transform inputs into outputs.

### N-gram Model

A language model that looks at sequences of *n* consecutive words or tokens to predict patterns.

### NLTK

A popular Python library for NLP tasks like tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging.

### One-Hot Encoding

A method of representing categorical data where each category is turned into a binary vector with a single ‚Äú1‚Äù marking its presence.

### Perplexity

A score for evaluating language models. Lower perplexity means the model predicts sequences with less uncertainty (better performance).

### PyTorch

A deep learning framework (developed by Meta) that is widely used for research and production due to its flexibility and dynamic computation graphs.

### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

A neural network designed for sequential data. It has loops in its structure, allowing past information to influence future outputs.

### Sequence-to-Sequence Model

A neural architecture for mapping one sequence to another, like translating sentences between languages.

### Skip-Gram Model

A word embedding model that predicts context words based on a given target word. It‚Äôs the opposite of CBOW.

### Word Embedding

A method of mapping words into continuous vector space such that similar words are located closer together.

### Word2Vec

A family of models (including CBOW and Skip-Gram) that learn high-quality word embeddings from large text corpora.

Would you like me to also **make this into a table** (like the original, with Term ‚Üí Definition) so you can keep it neat for revision?
