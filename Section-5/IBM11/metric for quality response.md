Alright, let’s unpack how these metrics actually *judge* your seq2seq model’s response, step by step 🌙

---

## 1. **BLEU (n-gram overlap)**

* Idea: *How many words/sequences in your output also appear in the reference(s)*.
* Example:

Reference: `Miya is sleeping on the couch.`
Prediction: `Miya sleeps on the sofa.`

* **BLEU-1 (unigram):** Matches words like *Miya, on, the*.
* **BLEU-2 (bigram):** Matches short word pairs like *on the*.
* Score = geometric mean of overlaps, with a penalty if your prediction is too short.

👉 Works well for machine translation but fails if synonyms are used (*sofa* vs *couch* gets penalized).

---

## 2. **ROUGE (recall of n-grams or subsequences)**

* Idea: *How much of the reference’s important content is covered by your prediction*.
* Variants:

  * ROUGE-1: overlap of single words.
  * ROUGE-2: overlap of word pairs.
  * ROUGE-L: longest common subsequence (keeps word order in mind).

Same example:

* ROUGE-1 catches overlap (*Miya, on, the*).
* ROUGE-L sees the sequence *on the* exists in both.

👉 Better for summarization, because it checks if your output recalls the key points.

---

## 3. **METEOR**

* Like BLEU but smarter: considers stemming (*sleep, sleeps*), synonyms (*sofa, couch*), and word order.
  👉 Closer to human judgment than BLEU.

---

## 4. **BERTScore**

* Idea: *Instead of word matching, compare meaning*.
* Uses contextual embeddings (BERT) to check if words in prediction are semantically close to words in reference.

Example: *sofa* vs *couch* → high similarity.
👉 Great for open-ended responses where wording can vary.

---

## 5. **Perplexity**

* Not about overlap — it checks how well your model predicts the next token.
* Low perplexity = model is confident and fluent.
  👉 Good during training, but doesn’t guarantee the *meaning* is right.

---

## 6. **Human Evaluation**

* Humans rate on scales like:

  * **Fluency** (does it read naturally?)
  * **Relevance** (did it answer the question?)
  * **Coherence** (does it make sense in context?).

👉 Still the ultimate test for chat models.

---

⚡️ So:

* BLEU/ROUGE = word overlap.
* METEOR = overlap + synonyms.
* BERTScore = semantic similarity.
* Perplexity = model confidence.
* Human eval = the true judge.

Want me to do a **side-by-side score demo with a real sentence** (I can calculate BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore for the Miya example) so you see how each metric reacts differently?
