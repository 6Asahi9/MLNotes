Test case design is basically the process of **figuring out all the different ways you can test a feature or system** to make sure it works correctly and doesn’t break under different conditions.

---

### 🛠️ **Definition**

* It’s a **structured way to create test cases** (step-by-step checks)
* Ensures **maximum coverage** of possible scenarios
* Helps **find bugs early** before real users face them

---

### 📜 **What a Test Case Usually Has**

* **Test Case ID** → unique number/name
* **Description** → what we’re testing
* **Preconditions** → setup needed before running test
* **Steps** → actions to take
* **Expected Result** → what should happen if it’s correct
* **Actual Result** → what actually happened (filled during execution)

### 🧠 **Example**

Feature: **Login Page**

| Test Case ID | Description        | Steps                                            | Expected Result           |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| TC01         | Valid login        | Enter correct username + password → Submit       | Redirect to dashboard ✅   |
| TC02         | Invalid password   | Enter correct username + wrong password → Submit | Show "Invalid password" ❌ |
| TC03         | Empty fields check | Leave username + password blank → Submit         | Show "Required field" ⚠️  |

---

### ✅ **Purpose of Designing It**

* Avoid missing important tests
* Ensure **all user scenarios** are checked (success, failure, edge cases)
* Standardizes testing so **any tester can run it** and get same results

Would you like me to also explain the **different test case design techniques** (like boundary testing, equivalence partitioning) that QA teams usually use?
