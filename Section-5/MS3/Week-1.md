### 🌟 Preparing Your Dataset for Fine-Tuning: A Step-by-Step Guide

Before training any machine learning model, it's important to make sure the data you're feeding into it is clean, well-structured, and easy for the model to understand. This process, called **preprocessing**, involves several steps—like cleaning the text, splitting datasets, and converting it into a machine-friendly format.

By the end of this guide, you’ll be able to:

* Tidy up raw text data and make it ready for model training
* Use tokenization and normalization to convert words into numerical inputs
* Organize your dataset to fine-tune models efficiently

---

### 📌 Overview of Steps

1. Load and organize the raw data
2. Clean and normalize the text
3. Tokenize using a model-compatible tokenizer
4. Handle missing or incomplete entries
5. Format the dataset for training
6. Split into training, validation, and testing sets

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Load and Structure the Raw Data

Start by loading your dataset (usually from a CSV or JSON) and arranging it into a format your ML framework understands—like a DataFrame or dictionary. Define labels and initialize any new columns you’ll use later, such as a cleaned version of the text.

```python
labels = torch.tensor(data['label'].tolist())
data['cleaned_text'] = [
    "Hello, I am a Bronze member!",
    "Silver membership offers perks.",
    "Gold members get premium benefits.",
    "Silver members enjoy discounts.",
    "Bronze is the starting tier."
]
```

---

### 🧼 Step 2: Clean the Text

Remove anything that might confuse the model—extra spaces, punctuation, links, or uppercase letters. The goal is consistency and simplicity.

```python
import re

def clean_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'http\S+', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip()
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
    return text
```

Cleaning like this helps the model focus on meaningful content rather than noisy formatting.

---

### ✂️ Step 3: Tokenize

Once the text is clean, convert it into tokens—small chunks the model can actually understand. Use a tokenizer that matches your model (like BERT's tokenizer for BERT models).

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

tokens = tokenizer(
    data['cleaned_text'].tolist(),
    padding=True,
    truncation=True,
    return_tensors='pt',
    max_length=128
)
```

---

### ❗ Step 4: Handle Missing Data

Datasets often contain incomplete rows. You can either remove them or fill in placeholders, depending on the context.

```python
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Option 1: Drop rows with missing values
data = data.dropna()

# Option 2: Fill empty entries with a default value
data['cleaned_text'].fillna('missing', inplace=True)
```

This ensures you don’t run into unexpected errors during training.

---

### 🧩 Step 5: Format for Model Training

Now that your text is cleaned and tokenized, combine it with the labels to create tensors. You’ll use these in batches during training.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

input_ids = tokens['input_ids']
attention_masks = tokens['attention_mask']
labels = torch.tensor(data['label'].tolist())

dataset = TensorDataset(input_ids, attention_masks, labels)
```

---

### 🔀 Step 6: Split into Train/Val/Test Sets

Dividing your data into **training**, **validation**, and **testing** sets helps track how well your model performs and generalizes to unseen inputs.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

train_val_inputs, test_inputs, train_val_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(
    input_ids, labels, test_size=0.1, random_state=42
)

train_inputs, val_inputs, train_labels, val_labels = train_test_split(
    train_val_inputs, train_val_labels, test_size=0.15, random_state=42
)
```

This two-level split ensures you have distinct data for training, validating during training, and finally testing after training is done.

---

### ✅ Final Thoughts

With your data preprocessed—cleaned, tokenized, and split—you’re ready to begin fine-tuning your model. These preparation steps are crucial to make sure your training is efficient, accurate, and less prone to errors.
