Absolutely, Asahi! Let‚Äôs walk through the **complete journey of your data** ‚Äî from messy human words to something BERT can munch on ‚Äî **step by step, column by column**, just like Miya silently watching every step from the shelf üêæüëÄ

---

## üõ§Ô∏è **Stage 0: Raw Data**

This is how your data looked originally:

```python
data_dict = {
    "text": [
        "  The staff was very kind and attentive to my needs!!!  ",
        "The waiting time was too long, and the staff was rude. Visit us at http://hospitalreviews.com",
        "The doctor answered all my questions...but the facility was outdated.   ",
        ...
    ],
    "label": ["positive", "negative", "neutral", ...]
}
```

So your initial DataFrame (`data`) looked like:

| text                                                         | label        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `"  The staff was very kind and attentive to my needs!!!  "` | `"positive"` |
| `"The waiting time was too long, and the staff was rude..."` | `"negative"` |
| ...                                                          | ...          |

---

## üßΩ **Stage 1: Cleaned Text**

You applied a `clean_text` function to normalize everything:

```python
def clean_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'http\S+', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip()
    return text

data["cleaned_text"] = data["text"].apply(clean_text)
```

Now your table looks like:

| text                                 | label        | cleaned\_text                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"  The staff was very kind..."`     | `"positive"` | `"the staff was very kind and attentive to my needs"`    |
| `"The waiting time was too long..."` | `"negative"` | `"the waiting time was too long and the staff was rude"` |
| ...                                  | ...          | ...                                                      |

---

## üî¢ **Stage 2: Convert Labels to Numbers**

You mapped strings to numbers:

```python
label_map = {"positive": 0, "neutral": 1, "negative": 2}
data["label"] = data["label"].map(label_map)
```

Now:

| cleaned\_text                        | label |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- |
| `"the staff was very kind..."`       | `0`   |
| `"the waiting time was too long..."` | `2`   |
| ...                                  | ...   |

---

## üß† **Stage 3: Tokenization (BERT style)**

You tokenized each sentence using BERT's tokenizer:

```python
data["tokenized"] = data["cleaned_text"].apply(lambda x: tokenizer.encode(x, add_special_tokens=True))
```

Now:

| cleaned\_text        | label | tokenized                          |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| `"the staff was..."` | 0     | `[101, 1996, 3095, 2001, ... 102]` |
| ...                  | ...   | ...                                |

(Where `101` = `[CLS]`, `102` = `[SEP]`)

---

## üìè **Stage 4: Padding**

You made all token sequences same length (128):

```python
data["padded_tokenized"] = data["tokenized"].apply(
    lambda x: x + [tokenizer.pad_token_id] * (128 - len(x)) if len(x) < 128 else x[:128]
)
```

Now:

| cleaned\_text | padded\_tokenized                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ...           | `[101, 1996, ..., 102, 0, 0, 0, ...]` |
| ...           | ...                                   |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Stage 5: Generate `input_ids` and `attention_mask`**

You used a function like this:

```python
def process(row):
    ids = row["padded_tokenized"]
    mask = [1 if token != tokenizer.pad_token_id else 0 for token in ids]
    return {"input_ids": ids, "attention_mask": mask}
```

Then:

```python
processed = data.apply(process, axis=1, result_type="expand")
data["input_ids"] = processed["input_ids"]
data["attention_mask"] = processed["attention_mask"]
```

Now your final table looks like:

| input\_ids            | attention\_mask  | label |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| `[101, 1996, ..., 0]` | `[1, 1, ..., 0]` | 0     |
| ...                   | ...              | ...   |

This is the **exact shape** that HuggingFace‚Äôs `Trainer` expects.
