Perfect, let’s break this into **4 sections** and explain it like we’re teaching Miya 🐾—no buzzwords, just clear meaning.

## **1️⃣ Principles of Sentiment Analysis**

How computers figure out feelings in text:

### **• Text Classification**

* The computer **labels** text into categories like *positive, negative, neutral*.
* Example: “Miya is the best cat!” → **Positive** ✅

### **• Polarity Detection**

* Checks if the feeling is **good or bad** (positive/negative) and sometimes **how strong** it is.
* Example:

  * “I love Miya a lot!” → Strong positive 💖
  * “I dislike homework.” → Negative 😒

### **• Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**

* **Subjective:** Personal opinion → “Miya is adorable.” 🥰
* **Objective:** Factual → “Miya is a white cat.” 🐈
* Helps avoid mixing facts with feelings.

## **2️⃣ Techniques Used in Sentiment Analysis**

### **• Rule-Based Approaches**

* Uses **manual rules or dictionaries** of positive/negative words.
* Example: “happy, love” = positive, “hate, bad” = negative.

### **• Machine Learning Approaches**

* Teaches the computer with **examples** (training data).
* It learns patterns to predict sentiment.

### **• Deep Learning & Neural Networks**

* More advanced → understands **context** and word relationships better.
* Great for complex sentences like sarcasm.

### **• Pretrained Models**

* Ready-made AI that already knows a lot about language.
* Example: Using a model like **BERT** instead of building from scratch.

## **3️⃣ Applications of Sentiment Analysis**

* **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Businesses learn what customers like or hate.
* **Social Media Monitoring:** Track reactions to posts/tweets.
* **Brand Sentiment Tracking:** Know how people feel about a company over time.
* **Political Sentiment & Opinion Mining:** Understand public opinion during elections.
* **Market Research:** Companies see trends before launching products.

## **4️⃣ Challenges in Sentiment Analysis**

### **• Handling Sarcasm & Irony**

* “Great job, Miya… you spilled the tuna.” (actually negative).

### **• Contextual Understanding**

* Words change meaning with context:

  * “Sick game!” → could mean **cool** (positive) or **illness** (negative).

### **• Multilingual Sentiment Analysis**

* People express emotions differently in other languages → hard to track globally.
