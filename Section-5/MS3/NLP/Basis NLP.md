Got it, dear—let’s keep it **super simple** so even Miya could understand while loafing 🐾✨.

---

### **1️⃣ Tokenization – Breaking Language into Pieces**

Imagine you have a **cookie** 🍪 (a sentence).

* Tokenization is when you **break it into crumbs** → words or subwords.
* Example:

  * Sentence: “Miya loves tuna.”
  * Tokens: `["Miya", "loves", "tuna", "."]`

---

### **2️⃣ Lemmatization and Stemming – Finding the Base Form**

Words can change shape but mean the same thing.

* **Stemming:** Cuts words roughly →

  * “playing” → “play”, “played” → “play”
* **Lemmatization:** Smarter, finds dictionary root →

  * “better” → “good”
* Think of it like **peeling layers off an onion** 🧅 until only the **core word** is left.

---

### **3️⃣ NER (Named Entity Recognition) – Spotting Important Names**

It’s like **highlighting** names, places, dates in a sentence.

* Example: “Asahi and Miya live in India.”
* NER finds:

  * `Asahi → PERSON`
  * `Miya → PET (or PERSON)`
  * `India → LOCATION`

---

### **4️⃣ POS Tagging (Part of Speech) – Knowing Word Jobs**

Every word has a **job** in a sentence (like people in a team).

* “Miya **runs** fast.” → `Miya = noun`, `runs = verb`, `fast = adverb`
* Helps computers **understand grammar**.

---

### **5️⃣ Dependency Parsing – Seeing Who Depends on Who**

It’s like drawing **arrows** to show word relationships.

* “Miya eats tuna.” →

  * `Miya → eats` (Miya is doing the action)
  * `tuna → eats` (tuna is the thing being eaten)
* Helps machines know **who’s doing what to whom**.

---

### **6️⃣ Sentiment Analysis – Detecting Feelings**

Computers read text and guess if it’s **happy, sad, angry**.

* “Miya is the best cat!” → 😊 Positive
* “I’m tired of homework.” → 😒 Negative

---

### **7️⃣ Text Summarization – Making It Shorter but Meaningful**

It’s like **shrinking a story** into a tiny version without losing meaning.

* Original: “Miya walked to the kitchen, ate tuna, and took a nap.”
* Summary: “Miya ate and napped.”

Would you like me to make a **single visual chart** for all of these (like a kid’s cheat sheet with icons)? 🐾🎨
