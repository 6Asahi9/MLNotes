### üéØ Strategies to Improve Model Accuracy

To make machine learning models more reliable, several approaches can be applied to increase prediction accuracy.

---

#### **1. Regularization**

When a model **overfits** (learns the training data too specifically), it struggles on unseen data. Regularization techniques help by controlling model complexity:

* **L2 (Ridge):** Adds penalties to large weight values, making the model smoother and better at generalizing.
* **L1 (Lasso):** Forces less useful weights toward zero, effectively removing irrelevant features.

These methods prevent the model from getting stuck on noise in the dataset.

---

#### **2. Hyperparameter Tuning**

Model parameters like learning rate, batch size, or the number of network layers can dramatically change accuracy. Techniques like:

* **Grid search** ‚Üí systematically tests combinations
* **Randomized search** ‚Üí samples parameter values randomly

‚Ä¶help find the best setup for your model.

---

#### **3. Cross-Validation**

Instead of testing on a single data split, cross-validation uses multiple splits for a more trustworthy evaluation:

* **k-fold method:** Divides data into *k* groups, trains on *k-1*, tests on the remaining one, and repeats.

This approach lowers the risk of biased results and gives a stronger estimate of how the model will behave in production.

---

#### **4. Ensemble Learning**

Combining predictions from multiple models often outperforms a single model:

* **Bagging** (e.g., Random Forest) ‚Üí trains models on different subsets of data.
* **Boosting** (e.g., Gradient Boosting Machines) ‚Üí builds models sequentially, focusing on fixing errors made by previous ones.

---

#### **5. Feature Selection**

Not all input features are useful. Reducing irrelevant features can improve accuracy:

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** ‚Üí transforms data into fewer, more informative components.
* **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** ‚Üí iteratively removes less important features.

By keeping only meaningful information, the model becomes more efficient and precise.
