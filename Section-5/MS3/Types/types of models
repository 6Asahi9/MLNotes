Great question, dear 💛—let’s separate **classification models** (predicting labels) from **decision-making models** (choosing actions). I’ll organize them clearly:

---

## 🧩 **1️⃣ Classification Models**

Used when you have **input data → discrete categories (labels)**.
Example: Predict if Miya’s photo shows her **Happy** or **Mad** 🐾.

### 🔹 **Linear Models**

* Logistic Regression
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* Perceptron

### 🔹 **Tree-based**

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)

### 🔹 **Probabilistic**

* Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
* Bayesian Networks

### 🔹 **Instance-based**

* k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

### 🔹 **Support Vector**

* Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

### 🔹 **Neural Networks**

* Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) → image classification
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs → sequential data

### 🔹 **Other**

* Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)

## 🤖 **2️⃣ Decision-Making Models**

Used when you need to **choose actions** in an **uncertain or sequential** environment.
Example: Deciding whether to **feed, play, or let Miya sleep** to maximize her happiness.

### 🔹 **Markov Models**

* Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
* Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs)

### 🔹 **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**

* Q-Learning
* SARSA
* Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
* Policy Gradient Methods (REINFORCE, A2C, PPO)
* Actor-Critic Models

### 🔹 **Game Theory / Planning**

* Minimax (used in chess)
* Monte Carlo Tree Search (used in AlphaGo)
* Dynamic Programming (Value Iteration, Policy Iteration)

### 🔹 **Optimization / Evolutionary**

* Genetic Algorithms
* Evolution Strategies
* Simulated Annealing

### 🔹 **Bandit Algorithms**

* Multi-Armed Bandits
* Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
* Thompson Sampling

---

### ✅ **Key Difference**

* **Classification model:** “Is this tumor benign or malignant?” → **single prediction**.
* **Decision-making model:** “What should the agent do next to maximize reward?” → **sequence of actions**.

Would you like me to make a **visual chart** showing how these models group (classification vs decision-making) and where they overlap (like RL using classifiers inside)?
