Mmmm you're asking the *right* kind of question now, Asahi 👀
The short answer is: those are the **main BERT hat types**, but not the **only** ones — there are a few more specialty hats in the wardrobe 🧢🪖👒

Let’s walk through all the common and a few spicy lesser-known ones:

## 👑 **Most common BERT hats (tasks):**

| Hat                                     | Class                                                       | What it does |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 🎩 `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` | Classifies whole text chunks (positive, spam, etc.)         |              |
| 🧵 `AutoModelForCausalLM`               | Generates text (GPT-style) — not BERT, but cousins use this |              |
| 📜 `AutoModelForMaskedLM`               | Predicts missing words — what BERT was originally made for  |              |
| 💬 `AutoModelForQuestionAnswering`      | Reads a passage + finds answer span inside it               |              |
| 🪢 `AutoModelForTokenClassification`    | Tags each word/token — used in NER, POS tagging             |              |
| 🔀 `AutoModelForMultipleChoice`         | Picks best answer from multiple given choices               |              |
| 🧠 `AutoModelForNextSentencePrediction` | Determines if sentence B logically follows sentence A       |              |
| 🧰 `AutoModel`                          | Base model = no task layer. Just hidden states. DIY hat.    |              |

## 🧤 A few lesser-known/advanced hats:

| Hat                                  | Class                                                                      | Use Case |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 🔬 `AutoModelForPreTraining`         | Pretrain from scratch (MLM + NSP)                                          |          |
| 🧱 `AutoModelForMaskedImageModeling` | For vision transformers (ViT), not BERT per se                             |          |
| 🤖 `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM`           | Encoder-decoder models like T5, BART (not BERT, but related)               |          |
| 🎯 CustomHeadBERT                    | Your own classifier or regression head (if HuggingFace doesn't provide it) |          |

## 🧠 How to pick a hat?

Ask yourself:

* “Do I want to classify the full input?” → 🎩
* “Do I want to tag every word?” → 🪢
* “Do I want the model to write text?” → 🧵 (but not BERT, use GPT-style)
* “Do I want it to answer from a passage?” → 💬
* “Do I want to train BERT from scratch?” → 🔬

## 🐾 Miya’s Hat Tip:

> *“A model without a task head is just a fluffy blob. Give it a purpose, or it’ll nap all day like me.”*

You can even build **custom heads** if your task is something weird like:

* Matching two sentences for similarity
* Classifying *paragraphs and sub-clauses* with different labels
* Or training Miya to detect paw rub frequencies in diary entries

Want an example of how to add your **own custom head** on top of BERT?
Or continue with the Trainer step and the datasets?
