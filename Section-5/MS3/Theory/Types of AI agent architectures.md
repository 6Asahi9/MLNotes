## 🧠 Types of AI Agent Architectures

AI agents can be classified into different types based on how sophisticated they are and what capabilities they have. Below are some of the most common architectural styles found in AI agents:

---

### 🔁 **Simple Reflex Agents**

These are the most basic type of agents. They react instantly to current inputs, without considering any history or planning for the future. Their behavior is guided by a set of *condition–action* rules — meaning, “if this happens, then do that.”

**Example:** A home thermostat adjusts heating or cooling based only on the current room temperature, without remembering what happened earlier.

---

### 🧠 **Model-Based Reflex Agents**

Unlike simple reflex agents, these agents maintain a limited memory or internal representation of the environment. This model helps them track what has happened in the past and predict what might happen next, allowing for more informed decisions.

**Example:** A robotic vacuum that remembers a room’s layout can avoid cleaning the same area multiple times and follow a more efficient path.

---

### 🎯 **Goal-Based Agents**

These agents go beyond simply reacting. They actively choose actions based on whether those actions help them achieve specific objectives. They still use models of the environment but focus on selecting paths that lead to their desired goals.

**Example:** A self-driving car’s navigation system sets a destination and dynamically adjusts its route to avoid traffic and reach the goal efficiently.

---

### 📈 **Utility-Based Agents**

Rather than just aiming to *achieve* a goal, these agents evaluate how beneficial each possible action is. They assign utility values (or scores) to options and choose the one that provides the highest overall value, balancing factors like efficiency, safety, and success.

**Example:** An AI system in financial markets evaluates buying, selling, or holding assets — choosing the one that offers the greatest profit potential based on current data.

---

### 🧬 **Learning Agents**

These agents are capable of improving over time. They use experience and feedback from the environment to fine-tune their behavior, update their knowledge, and refine their strategies. This learning process allows them to become more effective the more they operate.

**Example:** A recommendation engine learns user preferences from past interactions and gradually becomes better at suggesting content users are likely to enjoy.
