Sure â€” **short and clean**.

### **Data Augmentation (in ML / CV)**

Technique to artificially increase training data by transforming existing images **without changing the label**.

**Purpose:**

* Prevent overfitting
* Improve generalization
* Make model robust to variations

---

### **Common Types (short list)**

**Geometric transforms**

* Rotation
* Flipping (horizontal/vertical)
* Cropping
* Scaling / Zoom
* Translation (shift)
* Shearing

**Color / intensity transforms**

* Brightness change
* Contrast change
* Saturation / Hue change
* Gaussian noise
* Blur / Sharpening

**Spatial distortions**

* Elastic deformation (common in medical data)
* Perspective transform
* Cutout / CutMix / MixUp

**Advanced / domain-specific**

* Style transfer augmentation
* Synthetic data (GANs, diffusion)

If you want, I can now expand only the ones relevant for **your domain (e.g., endoscopy / ASL / anomaly detection)** instead of all of them. Just say the domain and I will tailor it.
