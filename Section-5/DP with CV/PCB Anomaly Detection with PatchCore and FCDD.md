Ah, dear, I see! You‚Äôre asking about **PCB anomaly detection** using **PatchCore** and **FCDD**. Let‚Äôs go **carefully step by step** so it‚Äôs clear. üå∏

### **1. What this is about**

PCB anomaly detection is about finding **defects on printed circuit boards (PCBs)** automatically. These defects could be:

* Missing components
* Misaligned parts
* Soldering issues
* Scratches or contamination

The challenge is that **defective samples are rare**, so these methods often focus on **unsupervised or one-class learning**, where the model mostly sees **normal PCBs** during training.

Two common methods for this are:

---

### **2. PatchCore**

**PatchCore** is a **state-of-the-art method for anomaly detection** based on **feature embedding**:

* **Idea:**

  1. Take **patches** (small regions) of normal images.
  2. Extract **features** using a pretrained CNN (like ResNet).
  3. Store these features in a **memory bank** (think of it like a reference of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù patterns).

* **Detection:**

  1. For a test image, extract patch features.
  2. Compare each patch to the memory bank using **nearest neighbor distances**.
  3. **High distance ‚Üí likely anomaly**.

* **Pros:**

  * Works well even with very few anomaly samples.
  * Produces a **pixel-level anomaly map**.

### **3. FCDD (Fully Convolutional Data Description)**

**FCDD** is another approach for anomaly detection:

* **Idea:**

  * Train a **fully convolutional neural network** to produce an **anomaly score map** for the entire image.
  * Uses **one-class learning**: learns **normal patterns**, then detects deviations.

* **Detection:**

  * Network outputs a **score map**, highlighting regions that look abnormal.
  * Can handle **arbitrary image sizes** since it‚Äôs fully convolutional.

* **Pros:**

  * Lightweight, works end-to-end.
  * Good for **pixel-level defect localization**.

### **4. How they relate to PCB detection**

* **PatchCore** ‚Üí very accurate for **fine-grained PCB defects**, especially when you have **lots of normal boards and very few anomalies**.

* **FCDD** ‚Üí simpler, easier to train, can produce **quick anomaly maps**.

* Typical workflow:

  1. Collect **images of normal PCBs**.
  2. Train PatchCore / FCDD model on normal images.
  3. Test on new PCBs. The model highlights **anomalous regions**.
  4. Evaluate using **pixel-level metrics** like IoU with ground truth defect masks.

### **5. Tools / Implementations**

* **PatchCore:**

  * Python implementation available in PyTorch: [PatchCore GitHub](https://github.com/amazon-science/patchcore-inspection)

* **FCDD:**

  * Python / PyTorch implementation: [FCDD GitHub](https://github.com/jo-sch/FCDD)

* **MATLAB:**

  * There‚Äôs no direct PatchCore implementation yet, but you can:

    * Use MATLAB‚Äôs **Deep Learning Toolbox** for feature extraction.
    * Build nearest-neighbor comparisons for PatchCore.
    * FCDD can be adapted using **fully convolutional layers** in MATLAB.

### **Summary**

| Method    | Type                   | Pros                                    | PCB Use Case                         |
| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| PatchCore | Patch-based feature NN | Very accurate, works with few anomalies | Detect small defects at patch level  |
| FCDD      | Fully convolutional    | Lightweight, end-to-end                 | Quick anomaly maps, simpler training |

‚úÖ **Key idea:** Both methods **learn normal patterns**, then detect deviations to find PCB defects.

If you want, dear, I can **show you a practical Python example for PCB anomaly detection using PatchCore**, so you can see how to feed PCB images and get anomaly maps.

Do you want me to do that?
