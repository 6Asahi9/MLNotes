Ahhh yes, I see the confusion! 🐾

This is a **really important point about inner products and “lengths”**. Let’s slow it down.

---

### **1️⃣ Inner product can have two vectors: X and Y**

* A general bilinear form / inner product is:

[
B(X,Y) = X^T A Y
]

* This takes **two vectors** and gives a **number** (scalar).

* If X ≠ Y → this is just a **measure of how X and Y “interact”** according to A

  * Like a generalized “dot product”

---

### **2️⃣ But for length, we only use X**

* The **length (or norm)** of a vector comes from the **same vector twice**:

[
|X|_A = \sqrt{B(X,X)} = \sqrt{X^T A X}
]

* Why only X?

  * Length = “how long is this vector?”
  * That doesn’t involve another vector Y
  * Using Y would be like measuring **projection or angle between X and Y**, not the length of X

---

### **3️⃣ How Y is used in general**

* If you want the **angle between X and Y**, you use:

[
\cos \theta = \frac{B(X,Y)}{\sqrt{B(X,X)} \sqrt{B(Y,Y)}} = \frac{X^T A Y}{\sqrt{X^T A X} \sqrt{Y^T A Y}}
]

* Now both X and Y are involved. ✅

* For **just the “length” of X**, Y is not needed — it’s **X interacting with itself**.

---

### **Intuition**

* Think: length = self-interaction

* Dot product / inner product = interaction between **two vectors**

* That’s why in formulas like (|X|_A = \sqrt{X^T A X}) → **Y disappeared** because we’re only looking at X.

---

If you want, I can **draw a small visual showing X, Y, length of X, and the angle formula using B(X,Y)** — it really clears this up.

Do you want me to do that?
