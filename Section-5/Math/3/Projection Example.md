Alright, let’s do a **full numeric example** slowly and clearly.

---

### Example setup

Let

```
A = ( 1 , 2 )         a point on the line
b = ( 3 , 1 )         direction of the line
E = ( 4 , 5 )         the point we want to project
```

---

### Step 1 — Compute (E − A)

```
E − A = (4−1 , 5−2) = (3 , 3)
```

---

### Step 2 — Compute dot products

We need:

```
(E − A) · b  =  (3 , 3) · (3 , 1)
             =  3*3 + 3*1
             =  9 + 3
             =  12
```

and

```
b · b  =  (3 , 1) · (3 , 1)
       =  3*3 + 1*1
       =  9 + 1
       =  10
```

---

### Step 3 — Compute t

```
t = 12 / 10 = 1.2
```

---

### Step 4 — Final projection:

```
P = A + t * b
  = (1 , 2) + 1.2 * (3 , 1)
  = (1 , 2) + (3.6 , 1.2)
  = (4.6 , 3.2)
```

---

### So the projected point is

```
P = (4.6 , 3.2)
```

That is the point on the line closest to `E`.

Tell me if you want:

1. Another example in **3D**
2. A picture / ASCII sketch of this
3. Or code in Python / C++ to compute it automatically

Just say which one.
