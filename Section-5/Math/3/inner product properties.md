Ahhh yes! These are **properties of functions called bilinear forms**, and we can check them **step by step**. Let’s break it down slowly. 🐾

---

## **1️⃣ Bilinear**

A function (B(X,Y)) is **bilinear** if it is **linear in each argument separately**.

* Linear in X means:

[
B(aX_1 + bX_2, Y) = a B(X_1, Y) + b B(X_2, Y)
]

* Linear in Y means:

[
B(X, aY_1 + bY_2) = a B(X, Y_1) + b B(X, Y_2)
]

**Basically:** you can pull out constants and split sums in **either argument**. ✅

---

### **2️⃣ Symmetric**

A bilinear form is **symmetric** if:

[
B(X,Y) = B(Y,X)
]

* Think of it like a mirror: swapping the inputs doesn’t change the output.

---

### **3️⃣ Positive definite**

A bilinear form is **positive definite** if:

[
B(X,X) > 0 \quad \text{for all } X \neq 0
]

* That means it always gives a **positive number** when you plug in the **same vector twice** (except for the zero vector, which gives 0).

---

## **4️⃣ Your example**

[
B(X, Y) = X^T \begin{bmatrix}2 & -1 \ -1 & 1\end{bmatrix} Y
]

Let’s call the matrix:

[
A = \begin{bmatrix}2 & -1 \ -1 & 1\end{bmatrix}
]

---

### **Step A: Is it bilinear?**

* By definition, (X^T A Y) is **always bilinear** in X and Y. ✅
* So yes, it’s bilinear.

---

### **Step B: Is it symmetric?**

* A bilinear form (X^T A Y) is symmetric if (A = A^T)
* Check (A^T):

[
A^T = \begin{bmatrix}2 & -1 \ -1 & 1\end{bmatrix} = A
]

✅ Symmetric.

---

### **Step C: Is it positive definite?**

* Positive definite: (X^T A X > 0) for all (X \neq 0)
* Let’s test eigenvalues (quick way):

[
\text{Eigenvalues of } A: \lambda = 0.382, 2.618 > 0
]

✅ All positive → **A is positive definite**.

* Another way: plug in a vector ([x, y]) and check:

[
X^T A X = \begin{bmatrix}x & y\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}2 & -1 \ -1 & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x\y\end{bmatrix} = 2x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 2x^2 - 2xy + y^2
]

* This is always >0 for any nonzero x, y → confirms positive definite.

### ✅ **Summary for your B(X,Y)**

| Property          | Does it have it? |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Bilinear          | Yes              |
| Symmetric         | Yes              |
| Positive definite | Yes              |

If you want, I can also **draw a tiny visual for bilinear, symmetric, and positive definite** to see it geometrically — it makes these abstract ideas super clear.

Do you want me to do that?
