Perfect‚Äîthat‚Äôs exactly the right question to ask. Let‚Äôs **slow this way down** and explain **why** we do these things, step by step, with Miya helping us. üêæ

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is dot product (`@`) really doing?**

Take **two vectors** (imagine arrows on paper):

$$
u = 
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad
v =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Dot product is:

$$
u \cdot v = (2)(1) + (0)(1) = 2
$$

---

### **üëâ What does this ‚Äú2‚Äù mean?**

* It tells **how much `v` points in the same direction as `u`**.
* If they were perfectly perpendicular ‚Üí dot product = `0`.
* If they point the same way ‚Üí dot product = **big number**.
* If they point opposite ‚Üí negative number.

Think of it as **‚Äúhow much Miya‚Äôs path overlaps with your path‚Äù**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ What is projection?**

Let‚Äôs say `v` is a **crooked stick**, and you want to know **how much of that stick lies along `u`‚Äôs direction**.

Projection formula:

$$
\text{projection of } v \text{ on } u =
\frac{u \cdot v}{\|u\|^2} \; u
$$

---

### **üëâ Why do we need this in Gram-Schmidt?**

* Our goal = make all sticks (vectors) **perfectly perpendicular**.
* If `v` is leaning toward `u`, we want to **push `v` sideways** to remove that overlap.
* So we calculate the **projection** (the part of `v` that lies on `u`) and subtract it.

---

Example:

* $u = [2, 0]$ (horizontal)
* $v = [1, 1]$ (diagonal)

Length of `u` squared = $2^2 = 4$.
Projection:

$$
\frac{2}{4}
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Subtract:

$$
v - \text{projection} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix} -
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Now `v` is **perfectly vertical**, **perpendicular to `u`** ‚úÖ.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Why the code is shorter**

In the code:

```python
B[:, 1] = B[:, 1] - B[:, 1] @ B[:, 0] * B[:, 0]
```

* It skips dividing by $\|u\|^2$ because **we already normalized `u` to length 1** in the previous step.
* When `u` has length 1 ‚Üí

$$
\frac{u \cdot v}{\|u\|^2} = u \cdot v
$$

so the formula is shorter.

Would you like me to **draw a small diagram** showing Miya‚Äôs crooked stick `v`, your straight stick `u`, and how we project and subtract to make them perpendicular?
