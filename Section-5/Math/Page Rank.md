Absolutely, dear! Let’s break this down step-by-step, block by block, so it’s clear and easy to understand. No rush, I’ll explain each part carefully. Ready? Here we go! 💖🐾

### 1. Setup and Imports

```python
%pylab notebook
import numpy as np
import numpy.linalg as la
from readonly.PageRankFunctions import *
np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)
```

* `%pylab notebook`: This is a magic command for Jupyter notebooks to enable interactive plots.
* `import numpy as np`: Imports the NumPy library, useful for numerical calculations and matrices.
* `import numpy.linalg as la`: Imports linear algebra functions like eigenvalues/eigenvectors under alias `la`.
* `from readonly.PageRankFunctions import *`: Imports helper functions related to PageRank (assumed provided).
* `np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)`: Makes NumPy print numbers without scientific notation for clarity.

---

### 2. Define Matrix `L`

```python
L = np.array([[0,   1/2, 1/3, 0, 0,   0   ],
              [1/3, 0,   0,   0, 1/2, 0   ],
              [1/3, 1/2, 0,   1, 0,   1/2 ],
              [1/3, 0,   1/3, 0, 1/2, 1/2 ],
              [0,   0,   0,   0, 0,   0   ],
              [0,   0,   1/3, 0, 0,   0   ]])
```

* This `6x6` matrix `L` represents a **link matrix** for a small "internet" of 6 websites.
* Each entry `L[i][j]` shows the probability of moving from website `j` to website `i`.
* For example, `L[0][1] = 1/2` means from site 1, there's a 50% chance of going to site 0.

---

### 3. Calculate Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of `L`

```python
eVals, eVecs = la.eig(L) # Gets the eigenvalues and vectors
order = np.absolute(eVals).argsort()[::-1] # Orders them by their eigenvalues
eVals = eVals[order]
eVecs = eVecs[:,order]
```

* `la.eig(L)` finds **eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors** of matrix `L`.
* Eigenvalues measure certain properties; eigenvectors correspond to directions in the space.
* We sort eigenvalues and eigenvectors in **descending order of absolute eigenvalue magnitude**.
* This helps us find the **principal eigenvector** — key for PageRank.

---

### 4. Extract the Principal Eigenvector

```python
r = eVecs[:, 0] # Sets r to be the principal eigenvector
100 * np.real(r / np.sum(r)) # Normalize so values sum to 1, then multiply by 100
```

* The principal eigenvector (first column of `eVecs`) represents the "importance" or PageRank scores.
* We normalize it so the sum of the vector equals 1 (to treat as probabilities), then multiply by 100 to scale nicely.
* `np.real()` ensures any tiny imaginary parts from calculations are ignored.

---

### 5. Initialize Vector `r` for Iteration

```python
r = 100 * np.ones(6) / 6 # Vector of length 6, all equal to 100/6 ≈ 16.67
r # Display its value
```

* We create an initial rank vector `r`, starting equally distributed.
* Each page starts with the same rank score.

---

### 6. Apply the Link Matrix to Vector `r`

```python
r = L @ r # Matrix multiplication of L and r
r # Show its value
```

* Multiplying `L` by `r` simulates one step of rank distribution.
* It redistributes rank scores according to link probabilities.

---

### 7. Repeated Application to Reach Convergence

```python
r = 100 * np.ones(6) / 6
for i in np.arange(100):
    r = L @ r
r
```

* Repeat matrix multiplication 100 times.
* This simulates the **power iteration method**, helping `r` converge to a stable rank vector.

---

### 8. Iteration Until Convergence with Tolerance Check

```python
r = 100 * np.ones(6) / 6
lastR = r
r = L @ r
i = 0
while la.norm(lastR - r) > 0.01:
    lastR = r
    r = L @ r
    i += 1
print(str(i) + " iterations to convergence.")
r
```

* Instead of fixed iterations, loop continues until changes become very small (less than `0.01` difference).
* `la.norm(lastR - r)` measures difference between iterations.
* Prints how many iterations it took to stabilize.

---

### 9. Define a Larger Link Matrix `L2`

```python
L2 = np.array([[0,   1/2, 1/3, 0, 0,   0,   0 ],
               [1/3, 0,   0,   0, 1/2, 0,   0 ],
               [1/3, 1/2, 0,   1, 0,   1/3, 0 ],
               [1/3, 0,   1/3, 0, 1/2, 1/3, 0 ],
               [0,   0,   0,   0, 0,   0,   0 ],
               [0,   0,   1/3, 0, 0,   0,   0 ],
               [0,   0,   0,   0, 0,   1/3, 1 ]])
```

* Similar to before, but now a `7x7` link matrix representing a bigger internet with 7 websites.

---

### 10. Iterative PageRank for `L2`

```python
r = 100 * np.ones(7) / 7
lastR = r
r = L2 @ r
i = 0
while la.norm(lastR - r) > 0.01:
    lastR = r
    r = L2 @ r
    i += 1
print(str(i) + " iterations to convergence.")
r
```

* Same power iteration, but on bigger matrix `L2`.

---

### 11. Introducing Damping Factor `d`

```python
d = 0.5
M = d * L2 + (1-d)/7 * np.ones([7, 7]) # J matrix is all ones
```

* `d` is the **damping factor** (usually around 0.85).
* `M` is the modified link matrix:

  * With probability `d`, follow the links (`L2`).
  * With probability `1 - d`, jump to any page randomly (`np.ones([7,7])` matrix).
* This models random surfing behavior on the internet, preventing rank sinks.

---

### 12. Iteration with Damping Matrix `M`

```python
r = 100 * np.ones(7) / 7
lastR = r
r = M @ r
i = 0
while la.norm(lastR - r) > 0.01:
    lastR = r
    r = M @ r
    i += 1
print(str(i) + " iterations to convergence.")
r
```

* Same iterative method but now using the damped matrix `M`.

---

### 13. PageRank Function Definition (Generalized)

```python
def pageRank(linkMatrix, d):
    n = linkMatrix.shape[0]
    M = d * linkMatrix + (1-d)/n * np.ones([n, n])
    r = 100 * np.ones(n) / n
    lastR = r
    r = M @ r
    while la.norm(lastR - r) > 0.01:
        lastR = r
        r = M @ r
    return r
```

* This function takes any link matrix and damping factor `d`.
* It builds the damped matrix `M`.
* Uses power iteration to calculate PageRank vector `r`.
* Returns the final PageRank scores.

---

### 14. Generating Random Internets and Testing PageRank

```python
generate_internet(5)
L = generate_internet(10)
pageRank(L, 1)
```

* `generate_internet(n)` creates a random internet link matrix with `n` websites.
* Then, PageRank is calculated for that internet.

---

### 15. Eigenvalue Method Comparison

```python
eVals, eVecs = la.eig(L)
order = np.absolute(eVals).argsort()[::-1]
eVals = eVals[order]
eVecs = eVecs[:,order]
r = eVecs[:, 0]
100 * np.real(r / np.sum(r))
```

* Compares the PageRank from power iteration with that from the eigenvalue method.

---

### 16. Plotting PageRank Scores

```python
%pylab notebook
r = pageRank(generate_internet(100), 0.9)
plt.bar(arange(r.shape[0]), r);
```

* Generates a 100-page internet.
* Calculates PageRank with damping 0.9.
* Draws a bar chart showing the PageRank scores for all pages.

---

### Summary:

* The code implements **PageRank**, which ranks web pages by importance based on the link structure.
* It uses **linear algebra**: eigenvectors and iterative methods.
* The **damping factor** models realistic surfing (random jumps).
* The function `pageRank` works for any size internet.

If you want, I can go even slower or explain any block more deeply. How’s this so far, dear? 💛🐾
