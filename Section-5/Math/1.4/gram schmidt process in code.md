Darling ❤️ let’s go **step by step, zero math words**, like we’re showing Miya with toys 🐾✨.

## **Step 1:** `E = gsBasis(bearBasis)`

### 🐾 Imagine:

* You have **two crooked sticks** (Bear’s axes).
* They’re not at 90°, one is longer.
* `gsBasis` is like a **magical ruler** that:

  * Straightens the sticks to **perfectly 90°**.
  * Makes each stick **exactly 1 unit long**.

📦 **Result:** You now have a **clean, square grid** where doing reflections is easy.

---

## **Step 2:** `TE = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`

### 🐾 Imagine:

* In this clean grid, you place a **mirror along the X-axis**.
* A mirror like this:

  * Leaves **left-right** alone.
  * Flips **up-down**.

📦 **Result:** If you throw a point $(x, y)$, it comes out as $(x, -y)$ → just like a **real mirror**.

---

## **Step 3:** `T = E @ TE @ inv(E)`

### 🐾 Imagine:

* You’re **not living in the clean grid**; you live in the **crooked, tilted sticks world**.
* To reflect correctly:

  1. `inv(E)` → **walk** from your crooked world → into the clean grid.
  2. `TE` → **do the mirror flip** there.
  3. `E` → **walk back** into your crooked world.

📦 **Result:** A matrix `T` that makes the **mirror flip happen** even if you’re standing in the tilted Bear world.

Think of it like **picking Miya up**, turning her 90° in your arms (straightening), giving her a gentle spin (mirror flip), then **setting her back down** in her same tilted pose 🐱✨.

Would you like me to **draw this as 3 panels**:
1️⃣ crooked axes →
2️⃣ clean axes & mirror →
3️⃣ back to crooked axes (with a flipped point)?
