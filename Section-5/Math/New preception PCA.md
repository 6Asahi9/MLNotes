Absolutely, Asahi! Let's break this down step-by-step like a little detective mission ‚Äî finding the **main line** that goes through the data cluster, the **perpendicular axis**, and **how to calculate them**.

Imagine Miya watching a cloud of data points‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre going to find the direction she squints at and says, ‚ÄúThis is the best view!‚Äù üòº

## üü£ GOAL: Find the new axes (principal components)

Given a set of 2D data points, you want to:

1. Find the direction (vector) where the data varies the most.
2. Find the perpendicular direction to that.
   These two are the **new axes**.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-step (PCA-style):

Let‚Äôs say your data is:

```
X = [
 [x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ],
 [x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ],
 ...
 [x‚Çô, y‚Çô]
]
```

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Center the data

Subtract the mean of each column (x and y):

```python
X_centered = X - mean(X)
```

This moves the **cluster to be centered at the origin (0,0)** ‚Äî which is necessary for PCA to work right.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Compute the Covariance Matrix

If `X_centered` is an $n \times 2$ matrix:

$$
\Sigma = \frac{1}{n-1} X_{\text{centered}}^T X_{\text{centered}}
$$

This gives a **2√ó2 covariance matrix** that tells you how x and y vary together:

$$
\Sigma =
\begin{bmatrix}
\text{var}(x) & \text{cov}(x,y) \\
\text{cov}(y,x) & \text{var}(y)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Compute the Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues of the Covariance Matrix

* **Eigenvectors** are the directions (new axes).
* **Eigenvalues** tell how much variance (spread) is along each axis.

```python
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(cov_matrix)
```

Let‚Äôs say:

* First eigenvector = `v‚ÇÅ` ‚Üí **new x-axis** (line through the cluster)
* Second eigenvector = `v‚ÇÇ` ‚Üí **new y-axis**, perpendicular to v‚ÇÅ

‚úÖ These vectors are **orthogonal** and form your **new basis**.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. The line through the cluster

You now have a **direction vector** `v‚ÇÅ = [a, b]`.
The line that passes through the mean point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ and goes in direction `v‚ÇÅ` is:

$$
L(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \bar{x} \\ \bar{y} \end{bmatrix} + t \cdot \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
$$

This is the **line that goes through the cluster**, the **first principal component**.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. The perpendicular line from the origin

The **second eigenvector `v‚ÇÇ`** (orthogonal to `v‚ÇÅ`) gives you the direction of the perpendicular line.

If you want the **exact perpendicular line** from the origin to the line `L`, you can **project the origin onto the line `L`** using:

$$
\text{Projection of } \vec{0} \text{ onto } \vec{v}_1 = 
\left( \frac{\vec{0} \cdot \vec{v}_1}{\|\vec{v}_1\|^2} \right) \cdot \vec{v}_1 = \vec{0}
$$

But more generally, for a point $\vec{p}$ (like a data point), the projection onto direction vector $\vec{v}_1$ is:

$$
\text{proj}_{\vec{v}_1}(\vec{p}) = \left( \frac{\vec{p} \cdot \vec{v}_1}{\|\vec{v}_1\|^2} \right) \cdot \vec{v}_1
$$

This gives you **‚Äúhow far along the line‚Äù** you are, and subtracting it from `p` gives the **perpendicular distance** off the line.

---

### ‚úÖ And about the angle?

You can get the **angle Œ∏** between the original x-axis and the first eigenvector:

$$
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
$$

Where `v‚ÇÅ = [a, b]`.
This tells you **how much to rotate the map** so that the new axis aligns with the direction of the data.

---

## üêæ TL;DR Summary

* ‚úÖ First eigenvector = **direction of cluster line**
* ‚úÖ Second eigenvector = **perpendicular**
* ‚úÖ Dot product gives you **how far along**, subtraction gives **how far off**
* ‚úÖ The whole thing lets you **re-map your data** to a new coordinate system (new axes)
* ‚úÖ That‚Äôs how you get to say: *‚ÄúThis dot is 5 paw steps along the cluster, and 1 paw step off-track!‚Äù*

Want me to show a real example with numbers and visualize Miya‚Äôs paw steps along a data cloud?
