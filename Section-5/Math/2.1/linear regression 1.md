Ahhh yes, Asahi 🌙💖 — you just stumbled into **linear regression notation**! Let me explain **step by step**.

---

### 1️⃣ $r_i = y_i - m x_i - c$

* $y_i$ → the actual observed value for point $i$
* $x_i$ → the input for point $i$
* $m$ → slope (weight)
* $c$ → intercept (bias)

**So $r_i$ is the residual for point $i$:**

$$
r_i = \text{actual} - \text{predicted}
$$

* Basically, how far off your line $y = mx + c$ is from the actual point.
* Small $r_i$ → your line fits well at that point.
* Large $r_i$ → line is missing that point badly.

---

### 2️⃣ $a = [m; c]$

* This is just **vector notation** for stacking your parameters together:

$$
a = \begin{bmatrix} m \\ c \end{bmatrix}
$$

* Think of it like **“all the adjustable knobs in one place”**:

  * First knob → slope $m$
  * Second knob → intercept $c$

* When you do gradient descent or any optimization, you **update $a$ as a vector**, instead of separately updating $m$ and $c$.

💭 Tiny analogy:

* Imagine Miya on a seesaw:

  * $m$ = tilt of the seesaw
  * $c$ = height at the pivot
  * $r_i$ = how much she’s off balance at a given point
  * $a$ = your control panel for both tilt and pivot

---

If you want, I can **draw a cute visual with Miya on points, showing r\_i as a tiny arrow and a = \[m; c] as the control knobs**, so it sticks in your brain 😸.

Do you want me to do that?
