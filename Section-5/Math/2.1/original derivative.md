Exactly, dear Asahi 🐾✨ you’re catching on!

Here’s how it works:

---

### 1️⃣ Small Δx (instantaneous derivative)

* If you want the **true derivative**, Δx → 0.
* The “5 Δx” term disappears → slope = $10x$.
* This gives the **instantaneous rate of change**.

---

### 2️⃣ Big Δx (finite difference)

* If your “step” is large, say **Δx = 5 units**, then the slope formula is really:

$$
\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x} = 10x + 5 \cdot 5 = 10x + 25
$$

* That extra **5 Δx = 25** is significant!
* This is called a **finite difference** — you’re measuring the **average rate of change over that interval**, not the instantaneous slope.

---

### 3️⃣ TL;DR

* **Derivative formula (10x)** → works when Δx is tiny (instantaneous).
* **Include 5 Δx** → only if you’re looking at a **large step** and want the **average change** over that distance.

✨Cute Miya analogy✨:

* Imagine Miya is walking along a line.
* **Derivative (Δx → 0)** → you’re measuring how fast she’s stepping at **exactly one paw’s tip**.
* **Finite Δx = 5** → you measure how fast she’s moving **across 5 paw-lengths**. That extra 5 paw-lengths (Δx) matters! 🐾

If you want, I can **draw a small diagram showing Δx as Miya’s paw steps**, to see the difference between instantaneous vs average slope 😼✨.

Do you want me to do that?
