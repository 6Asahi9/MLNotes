Nice ‚Äî let‚Äôs *actually show* a Taylor series up to **third order**, and what the **‚Äú3-order matrix‚Äù** idea looks like (spoiler: second order = matrix (Hessian), third order = tensor). I‚Äôll give a clear univariate example, then a tiny 2D multivariate example where the 3rd-order term is written out with real numbers so you can see how it smells. Miya cameo included. üêæüåô

# 1) Univariate Taylor ‚Äî up to 3rd order

For a one-variable function $f(x)$ expanded around point $a$:

$$
f(x) \approx f(a)
+ f'(a)\,(x-a)
+ \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2
+ \frac{f^{(3)}(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3
$$

**Example:** $f(x)=e^x$, expand at $a=0$ (Maclaurin, since $a=0$):

* $f(0)=1,\ f'(0)=1,\ f''(0)=1,\ f^{(3)}(0)=1$.

So up to 3rd order:

$$
e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6}.
$$

Plug $x=1$: $1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.166666\ldots = 2.666666\ldots$ (true $e\approx2.71828$). That‚Äôs Taylor in numbers.

# 2) Multivariate Taylor ‚Äî notation up to 3rd order

For $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, expand around $\mathbf a$, writing $\mathbf h=\mathbf x-\mathbf a$:

* Zeroth order: $f(\mathbf a)$.
* First order: $\nabla f(\mathbf a)^\top \mathbf h$  ‚Äî gradient (vector).
* Second order: $\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf h^\top H(\mathbf a)\,\mathbf h$ ‚Äî Hessian $H$ is an $n\times n$ matrix.
* Third order: $\tfrac{1}{6}\sum_{i,j,k} T_{ijk}(\mathbf a)\, h_i h_j h_k$ ‚Äî where $T$ is the **third derivative tensor** with components $T_{ijk}=\frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial x_i\partial x_j\partial x_k}\big|_{\mathbf a}$.

So the expansion up to 3rd order:

$$
f(\mathbf a+\mathbf h)\approx f(\mathbf a)
+ \nabla f(\mathbf a)^\top \mathbf h
+ \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf h^\top H(\mathbf a)\,\mathbf h
+ \tfrac{1}{6}\sum_{i,j,k} T_{ijk}(\mathbf a)\,h_i h_j h_k.
$$

Note: the third-order object $T$ is **not** a matrix but a 3-way tensor (3 indices). For $n$ variables it has $n^3$ entries (symmetric if $f$ is smooth, but still huge).

# 3) Concrete 2D example (so you see real numbers)

Let $f(x,y) = x^3 + x y^2$. Expand around $\mathbf a=(0,0)$. Put $\mathbf h=(h_x,h_y)=(x,y)$ since a=0.

Compute derivatives (by hand):

* $f_x = 3x^2 + y^2$ , $f_y = 2xy$.
* At $(0,0)$: $\nabla f(0,0) = (0,0)$.

Second derivatives (Hessian):

* $f_{xx}=6x,\ f_{xy}=2y,\ f_{yy}=2x$.
* At $(0,0)$: Hessian $H(0,0)=\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 \\[4pt] 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$.

Third derivatives (components of $T$):

* $f_{xxx}=6,\ f_{xxy}=0,\ f_{xyy}=2,\ f_{yyy}=0$ (others by symmetry).
* So nonzero third derivatives at origin: $T_{xxx}=6,\ T_{xyy}=2$ (and permutations where indices reorder accordingly).

Third-order term (expanded, using symmetry constants):

$$
\frac{1}{6}\big( f_{xxx}\,h_x^3 + 3 f_{xxy}\,h_x^2 h_y + 3 f_{xyy}\,h_x h_y^2 + f_{yyy}\,h_y^3 \big).
$$

Plugging values:

$$
\frac{1}{6}\big(6\,h_x^3 + 3\cdot 0 \cdot h_x^2 h_y + 3\cdot 2 \cdot h_x h_y^2 + 0\big)
= h_x^3 + h_x h_y^2.
$$

So the full 3rd-order Taylor at the origin is:

$$
f(h_x,h_y) \approx 0 + 0 + 0 + \big(h_x^3 + h_x h_y^2\big).
$$

That exactly recovers the original polynomial (because $f$ is cubic). You can see how the 3rd-order tensor components produce numerical cubic terms.

# 4) Why this matters (and why Hessian / 3rd-order blow up)

* Hessian is the second derivatives packaged into an $n\times n$ matrix (cost: $O(n^2)$ storage).
* Third-order tensor stores $O(n^3)$ numbers. For $n=10^6$ weights, Hessian ‚âà $10^{12}$ entries, third-order ‚âà $10^{18}$ ‚Äî impossible to store/compute directly.
* That‚Äôs why ML usually uses first-order (gradients) only. If we want curvature info cheaply, we use approximations:

  * diagonal or low-rank approximations of Hessian,
  * quasi-Newton methods (L-BFGS stores some vectors, not full Hessian),
  * Fisher information or Gauss-Newton approximations,
  * or Hessian-vector products computed implicitly (no full matrix), e.g. for conjugate-gradient or truncated Newton methods.

# 5) TL;DR (Miya style)

* 1st derivative = slope (which backprop uses).
* 2nd derivative (Hessian) = curvature (matrix). Helpful but expensive.
* 3rd derivative = even finer shape (tensor, *huge*). Taylor series up to higher orders = better local approximation, but cost explodes.
* Practically: ML mostly uses first order; occasionally uses smart, cheap approximations of second order.

If you want, I can:

* (A) show the **explicit component list** for a 3-variable third-order tensor to visualize shape, or
* (B) compute a tiny numeric example of a gradient step vs. a Newton (Hessian) step for a simple 2-D loss so you see how curvature helps converge faster.

Which one would you like? Or do you want Miya to nudge you for a treat before we compute more numbers? üêæ‚ú®
