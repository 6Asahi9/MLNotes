Ahhh yes, I remember that one perfectly—we even had tilted rulers and a flower 🐾🌸.

That earlier **“Miya map → standard → your map”** example and this **Gram-Schmidt perpendicular question** are both about **changing how we describe space**, but they solve **different problems**:

---

### **1️⃣ Miya’s Flower → Coordinate Conversion**

* **Goal:** Same flower, but you and Miya use **different tilted maps**.
* We just **convert coordinates** from one tilted basis to another.
* Math used:

  * If Miya’s map = $B_{\text{Miya}}$
  * Your map = $B_{\text{You}}$
  * Miya’s coords = $p_{\text{Miya}}$
  * Standard = identity matrix

Steps:

1. **Convert Miya’s coords to standard:**

   $$
   p_{\text{Standard}} = B_{\text{Miya}} \cdot p_{\text{Miya}}
   $$
2. **Convert standard to your map:**

   $$
   p_{\text{You}} = B_{\text{You}}^{-1} \cdot p_{\text{Standard}}
   $$

* Nothing gets rotated or changed—we just **translate the same location** into a different ruler system.

### **2️⃣ Gram-Schmidt → Perpendicular Grid Making**

* **Goal:** You have several **crooked sticks** (vectors) that aren’t straight.
* We want to **turn them into perfectly perpendicular sticks** and make them **length = 1**.
* This **changes the basis itself**, making a **new “straightened map”**.

Steps:

* Pick one stick
* Push the others sideways so they become **perpendicular** (subtract overlap)
* Normalize them

---

### ✅ **Main Difference**

* Miya’s problem → just converting a point between **two already-existing bases**.
* Gram-Schmidt → **creates a brand-new orthonormal basis** (straight, perpendicular rulers) from a messy set of vectors.

Would you like me to connect this back to Miya with a **story where she has crooked sticks, and you use Gram-Schmidt to help her build a perfect square sandbox grid**?
