### Advanced Topics to Study & Implement:
* Feature Engineering & Selection
* Bias-variance tradeoff

### Standardization (Min-Max Scaling, Z-score Normalization)
* Polynomial Features (to capture non-linearity)
* Handling Multicollinearity (VIF, PCA)
* Encoding Categorical Variables (One-Hot, Label Encoding)
### Optimization & Performance Improvements

* Gradient Descent Variants (Momentum, RMSprop, Adam)
* Regularization (L1/L2 for sparsity & generalization)
* Feature Importance using SHAP or Mutual Information
### Model Evaluation & Interpretation

* Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall, ROC Curve
* AUC-ROC Score, Log Loss
* Bias-Variance Tradeoff
### Handling Imbalanced Data

* Oversampling (SMOTE), Undersampling
* Cost-Sensitive Learning
### Comparing with Other Models

* Compare with Decision Trees, SVM, or Neural Networks
* Explain when logistic regression is preferable
### Deploying the Model

* Convert into an API using Flask or FastAPI
* Visualize decision boundaries interactively
### Making It Unique & Engaging

* Use a real-world dataset (healthcare, finance, fraud detection)
* Add visualizations with Matplotlib/Seaborn
* Write a well-documented report or interactive notebook
