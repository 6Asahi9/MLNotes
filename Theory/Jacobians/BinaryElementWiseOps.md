The person in the video is probably talking about the Jacobian of an element-wise operation (like those binary element-wise ops we talked about earlier).

When they said "all the non-diagonal elements are zero," they mean that the Jacobian matrix is diagonal. Here’s why:

### 1️⃣ What Does This Mean?
A Jacobian matrix tells us how the output of a function changes with respect to its inputs. If we apply an element-wise function, each output only depends on its corresponding input and not on other inputs.

That means:

* The derivative of output_i with respect to input_i is some value. ✅
* The derivative of output_i with respect to input_j (where i ≠ j) is 0, because changing input_j doesn’t affect output_i. ❌

### 3️⃣ Why Should You Care?
A diagonal Jacobian is super efficient because:

✅ Faster computation – We only store and compute n values instead of an entire matrix.

✅ Easy backpropagation – During training, gradient updates become simpler because we don’t need to consider interactions between different inputs.

✅ Optimized for element-wise transformations like ReLU, sigmoid, or scaling.

So, when the video says "all the non-diagonal elements are zero," it’s just telling you:

➡️ Each output only depends on its own input.

➡️ The Jacobian is diagonal, which makes computation easier! 🚀
