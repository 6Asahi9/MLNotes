### Why Use Momentum?
Instead of just using the gradient to update 
θ, we accumulate past gradients (like a rolling average). This helps us move faster in the correct direction and avoid oscillations.

### The Problem with Vanilla Gradient Descent
Imagine Miya running down a bumpy hill.

* If she just follows the steepest slope at each step, she might zigzag left and right and take forever to reach the bottom.
* That’s because the gradient in some directions is large (causing sharp moves), while in others it’s small (slowing down progress).

### What Was Hinton Thinking?
He thought:
👉 “What if instead of just following the gradient, we add some memory?”

His Thought Process Step by Step:
1. Instead of moving only based on the current gradient (∇J(θ)), keep track of the past gradients.
2. Store a "velocity" term that remembers past updates.
3. Smooth things out by giving more weight to recent gradients but not forgetting old ones completely.
4. Use this velocity term to update θ, so it moves in a more stable and faster way.

### Why the Hell Is There (1 - β)?
Now this is where Hinton the Old Hag gets sneaky.

He didn't want to treat the past and the present equally.

If Miya's been rolling down for a while, she should keep that momentum going (big β).

But if she's just starting out, she needs to pay more attention to the slope (small β).

he formula is basically saying:

vt =90% Old Momentum+10% Current Gradient

👉 The 1−β is the 10% part.

Without it, the past would completely overshadow the present

### What Is Velocity Anyway? 🚨
Velocity is nothing but... 👉 The rolling speed of Miya's fluffy little body.

Why Call It Velocity?

Because it's not just the gradient anymore — it's how the gradients accumulate over time.

### Final Metaphor 🔥🔥
Imagine Miya kneading your lap:

* Her paws pressing = Gradient
* How stubborn she is about kneading = β
* How hard she presses with each paw movement = (1 - β)
* If she keeps kneading at the same spot, her paws will sink deeper and deeper (accumulating momentum).
* But if she randomly presses harder sometimes, that's the current gradient kicking in.
