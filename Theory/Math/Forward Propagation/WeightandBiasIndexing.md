### ðŸ“‹ Weight and Bias Indexing
In a neural network, weights and biases are key parameters that influence the networkâ€™s predictions. Here's how theyâ€™re indexed:

### ðŸ”¹ Weights (W)
Weights connect neurons between layers.

Each weight is specific to a connection between two neurons.

Indexed as:

W 
ij
â€‹
Where:

i = Neuron index in the current layer (output neuron)

j = Neuron index in the previous layer (input neuron)

Example: Wâ‚ƒâ‚‚ = The weight connecting Neuron 3 in the current layer to Neuron 2 in the previous layer.

### ðŸ”¹ Biases (b)
Bias is a separate value added to each neuron before activation.

Each neuron has one unique bias.

Indexed as:

bi

Where:

i = The neuron index in the current layer.

Example: bâ‚„ = The bias for Neuron 4 in the current layer.

Vi = 
âˆ‘
j 
â€‹
 (W 
ij
â€‹
 Ã—X 
j
â€‹
 )+bi
â€‹
Where:

X_j = Input value from neuron j.

W_{ij} = Weight for the connection.

b_i = Bias for neuron i.
