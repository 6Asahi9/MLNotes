### Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) combines:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Momentum (helps with speed)

2Ô∏è‚É£ RMSprop (helps with stability)

### Why do we need vt hat and st hat
These are called bias-corrected estimates. The reason we use them is because at the beginning of training, both vt(momemtum) and st(RMSprop) Start from zero. Since they use an exponential moving average (EMA), early values are biased towards zero.

üîç Problem: Exponential moving average starts small

### Why does xt update like that?
1.(momentum) vt hat

* Moves in the correct average direction, not just reacting to the latest gradient.
* Think of it like a rolling ball instead of taking single steps.

2. (RMSprop scaling) root st hat

* Prevents huge updates when gradients are large.
* If gradients are small, updates stay normal (because dividing by a small number keeps it large).
