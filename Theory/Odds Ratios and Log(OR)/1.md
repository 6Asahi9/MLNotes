### 🐾 Imagine This: Miya vs. Non-Miya Cats
Let’s say we’re studying whether cats who have Asahi as their owner (Miya) are more likely to be spoiled compared to random non-Miya cats.

We collect data and get a table like this:

Spoiled	Not Spoiled
1. Miya-like Cats 🐱 
  * spoiled : 𝑎 = 30
  * not spolied :  𝑏 = 10 
2. Non-Miya Cats 😾  
  * spoiled : c = 15
  * not spolied :  d = 45

### 📌 What’s the Odds Ratio (OR)?
Odds Ratio compares the odds of an event happening in one group versus another.

OR = (a/b) / (c/d)

OR = (30/10) / (51/45) = 9
* An OR of 9 means Miya-like cats are 9 times more likely to be spoiled compared to non-Miya cats!

###  What’s Log(Odds Ratio)?
Instead of working with OR directly, we often take the natural logarithm (ln) to make calculations easier in stats models like logistic regression.

log(OR) = log(9) ≈ 2.2

Why use Log(OR)?

1. Makes the scale symmetric (e.g., Log(OR) = 0 means equal odds, positive = higher odds, negative = lower odds).
2. Better for regression models (linear relationships instead of multiplicative).
3. Handles extreme OR values better (since OR can range from 0 to ∞, but Log(OR) keeps things balanced).
