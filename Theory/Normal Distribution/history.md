### Why Was the Normal Distribution Made?
Back in the 1700s, Gauss (and a few other mathematicians before him) noticed that random errors in measurements tended to form a bell-shaped curve when plotted. People were making lots of measurements in astronomy, physics, and statistics, but errors would naturally happen. The idea was:

* Small errors happened often.
* Big errors were rare.
* Errors followed a predictable pattern

Gauss developed the Gaussian (Normal) Distribution as a mathematical way to describe these errors. He wanted a way to say, "If you measure something many times, how far off will your results be from the real value?"

### Why Is It Important in ML?
* Many real-world things follow a normal distribution (heights, test scores, IQ, noise in data, etc.).
* ML models assume normality in data for techniques like Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks.
* Feature Scaling often uses the assumption that data is normally distributed for better performance

So, Gauss wasn’t just making math for fun—he was trying to predict and control randomness in the world, and ML still relies on his ideas today!
