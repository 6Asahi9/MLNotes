### 1️⃣ Understanding the Exponent: - (x−μ)^2 / 2σ^2
This exponent controls how much 𝑒 gets shrunk down.

* x−μ → Distance from the mean.
* Squaring (x−μ)^2 → Makes all values positive, so being far from the mean matters equally in both directions.
* 2σ^2 in the denominator → Spreads out the curve based on standard deviation 𝜎
* If 𝑥 is close to 𝜇 (the mean), the exponent is small → 𝑒^0 =1, meaning the highest value is at the center.
*  If 𝑥 is far from 𝜇, the exponent is large and negative → 𝑒^-big number shrinks towards zero.

### 2️⃣ What Does 𝑒 Do?
Eular's number e ≈2.718 is a decay factor. Since it’s raised to a negative power, it shrinks values rather than growing them.
* at x = μ, the exponent is zero, so e^0 =1 → The peak of the bell curve.
* As 𝑥 moves away from μ, the exponent becomes more negative, so 𝑒^(negative number) shrinks rapidly → The sides of the bell curve drop down.

### 3️⃣ How Does It Shape the Bell Curve?

* High probability near the mean -> Beacuse e^0 = 1 the highest value is at x=μ.
* Lower probability far from the mean → As x moves away, the exponent makes 𝑒 shrink exponentially

### 💡 Think of it like Miya’s reaction to food:

* If Asahi gives Miya her favorite treat (mean μ), she is very happy (high probability).
* If Asahi gives her a random vegetable (far from μ), she hates it (very low probability, close to zero).
* If Asahi gives her something kind of acceptable (slightly away from μ), she might eat it but won’t love it (medium probability).
