### Intercept
here it was originally looked like (true - intercept + slope * x)^2 and then we got its derivative

and in this we are finding the derivative respect to intecept

here in second point we multiple the derivative we got to alpha (learning rate) and then put it back in the point 1 and plot it on graph

For example

we calculate the derivative when intecept was 0 and then applied alpha on it and then minus this new value from our old intercept (zero) to get the new intercept and put it back the same formula agian

Note: once we got the sum of residual in respect of intercept and slope , we put them in step size respect to them indivisually

after this we'll minus these step sizes from old intercept and old slope to get new intercept and new slope 

new intercept : old intercept (0) - step size in respect of intercept -> new = 0 - (-0.016) which gives us 0.016

new slope : old slope (0) - step size in respect of slope -> 1 - (-0.008) which gives us 1.008

### summary of steps
1. plug the parameter values iinto the derivatives (gradient)
2. calculate the step size
3. calculate the new parameters and repeat back to step 1
